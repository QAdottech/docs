# Configuration Settings

QA.tech provides comprehensive configuration options organized by specific features and functionality. Each setting is designed to help you optimize your AI-powered testing setup for your specific needs.

## Settings Organization

**Feature-Based Structure:**
Configuration options are organized by specific functionality rather than generic "advanced" categories:

### Authentication & Security
- **[Authentication](/configuration/authentication)** - Multi-factor authentication and account security
- **[IP Access Control](/configuration/ip-access-control)** - Network security and access management
- **[Auth Rate Limits](/configuration/auth-rate-limits)** - API rate limiting and protection

### Development & Deployment
- **[GitHub Integration](/configuration/github)** - GitHub Actions and repository integration
- **[GitLab Integration](/configuration/gitlab)** - GitLab CI/CD pipeline integration
- **[Envoyer Integration](/configuration/envoyer)** - Deployment automation and monitoring

### Environment Management
- **[Environment Setup](/configuration/environment-setup)** - Multi-environment configuration and management
