Integrate QA.tech into your CI/CD workflows with the GitHub Action. You control which tests run, when they run, and which environments to test.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Secrets">
    Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
    
    - `QATECH_API_TOKEN` - Your QA.tech API token
    - `QATECH_PROJECT_ID` - Your QA.tech project ID
    
    You can find these values in your [project settings](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/integrations).
    
    Learn more about [creating secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Workflow File">
    Create `.github/workflows/qatech.yml` in your repository:

    ```yaml
    name: QA.tech Tests
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
            with:
              project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
              api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
              blocking: true
    ```

    This runs all tests in your project whenever code is pushed to `main`. The `blocking` option waits for test results before completing the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Your First Run">
    Push to your main branch or open a PR (depending on your workflow configuration). QA.tech will execute your tests and report results directly in the GitHub Actions UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to run tests is without any additional configuration:

```yaml
- uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
  with:
    project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
    api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
    blocking: true  # Wait for results before continuing
```

This executes all tests in your project. For more control, see the examples below.

## Testing Pull Requests

Run tests automatically when PRs are opened or updated:

```yaml
name: QA.tech PR Tests
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
          test_plan_short_id: 'smoke-tests'  # Optional: run specific plan
          blocking: true
```

**When to use:**
- Catch issues before merge
- Validate changes against existing tests
- Gate PRs based on test results

## Testing Preview Deployments

Test preview environments with dynamic URLs:

```yaml
name: Test Preview Deployment
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      preview_url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        id: deploy
        run: |
          # Your deployment logic
          echo "url=https://preview-${{ github.event.number }}.vercel.app" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  test:
    needs: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
          test_plan_short_id: 'regression-suite'
          blocking: true
          applications_config: |
            {
              "applications": {
                "frontend-app-id": {
                  "environment": {
                    "url": "${{ needs.deploy.outputs.preview_url }}",
                    "name": "PR-${{ github.event.number }}"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
```

**When to use:**
- Testing Vercel/Netlify preview deployments
- Multi-environment testing (frontend + backend)
- PR-specific URL testing

## Scheduled Testing

Run tests on a schedule (e.g., nightly regression suite):

```yaml
name: Nightly Tests
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
          test_plan_short_id: 'full-regression'
          blocking: false  # Don't block on schedule
```

**When to use:**
- Comprehensive nightly regression testing
- Production smoke tests
- Load testing during off-peak hours

## Direct API Integration

If you prefer direct API calls instead of the GitHub Action, you can use the REST API.

### Basic Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $QATECH_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"testPlanShortId": "your-test-plan-id"}' \
  https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/$QATECH_PROJECT_ID/runs
```

### With Environment Overrides

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $QATECH_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "testPlanShortId": "your-test-plan-id",
    "applications": {
      "app-short-id": {
        "environment": {
          "url": "https://preview.example.com",
          "name": "Preview Environment"
        }
      }
    }
  }' \
  https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/$QATECH_PROJECT_ID/runs
```

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "run": {
    "id": "run_abc123",
    "shortId": "abc123",
    "url": "https://app.qa.tech/projects/project-123/results/abc123",
    "testCount": 5
  }
}
```

See the [Start Run API Reference](/api-reference/start-run) for complete documentation including error responses and authentication details.

## Exploratory Testing with @qatech

<Warning>
**Private Beta** - This feature is currently in private beta. Request access by emailing daniel@qa.tech
</Warning>

Trigger deep exploratory testing on any pull request by mentioning `@qatech` in a PR comment. The AI agent analyzes your changes, discovers functionality gaps, creates tests, and provides detailed feedback.

<Note>
This is different from [automatic PR reviews](/configuration/github-app). Exploratory testing is on-demand and focuses on discovering issues through interactive testing, while automatic reviews run on every PR.
</Note>

**How it works:**

Mention `@qatech` anywhere in a PR comment:

```
@qatech please test the new payment flow
```

The agent will:
1. **Analyze changes** - Examines PR diff and crawls the preview deployment
2. **Check coverage** - Identifies which existing tests apply
3. **Create tests** - Generates new tests for untested functionality
4. **Run tests** - Executes relevant tests against the PR preview
5. **Post review** - Writes a detailed GitHub review with findings

**When to use exploratory testing vs automatic reviews:**

| Use Exploratory Testing | Use Automatic PR Reviews |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Deep investigation of complex changes | Every PR as standard gating |
| Interactive testing with custom instructions | Hands-off automated coverage |
| Specific areas need thorough validation | General functional regression |
| Debugging test failures | Consistent baseline testing |

**Example use cases:**
- "Test the entire checkout flow with different payment methods"
- "Explore what happens when users upload large files"
- "Check if the new search handles edge cases"

**Request private beta access:**

Email daniel@qa.tech with:
- Organization name
- GitHub repository
- Use case (what you want to test)

You'll receive setup instructions and access within 1-2 business days.
