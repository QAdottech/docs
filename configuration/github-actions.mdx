        <Steps>
            <Step title="Configure Secrets">
                Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
                
                - `QATECH_API_TOKEN` - Your QA.tech API token
                - `QATECH_PROJECT_ID` - Your QA.tech project ID
                
                You can find these values in your [project settings](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/integrations).
                
                Learn more about [creating secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).
            </Step>
            
            <Step title="Basic Setup">
                Create a new workflow file in your repository at `.github/workflows/qatech.yml`:

                ```yaml
                name: QA.tech Tests
                on:
                  push:
                    branches:
                      - main

                jobs:
                  test:
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                    steps:
                      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                        with:
                          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                          blocking: true
                ```

          This will run all tests in your project whenever code is pushed to the main branch, and the blocking option will make it wait for the result of the run before completing the workflow.

 </Step>

            <Step title="Advanced Setup">
                For more control, you can:

                1. Run specific test plans by adding their IDs:
                ```yaml
                - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                  with:
                    project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                    api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                    test_plan_short_id: 'abc123'
                    blocking: true
                ```

                2. Trigger tests after deployment:
                ```yaml
                name: 'Deploy and Test'
                jobs:
                  deploy:
                    # Your deployment steps here

                  qatech-tests:
                    needs: deploy
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                    steps:
                      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                        with:
                          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                          blocking: true
                ```
            </Step>
        </Steps>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Action Options">
        The QA.tech GitHub Action accepts the following inputs:

        | Input | Description | Required | Default |
        |-------|-------------|----------|---------|
        | `project_id` | Your QA.tech project ID | Yes | - |
        | `api_token` | QA.tech API token | Yes | - |
        | `api_url` | Custom API URL if needed | No | https://app.qa.tech |
        | `test_plan_short_id` | Test plan short ID to run | No | - |
        | `blocking` | Wait for test results before completing the workflow | No | false |
        | `applications_config` | JSON string containing application environment overrides | No | - |

        The action outputs include:

        | Output | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | `runId` | The ID of the created test run |
        | `runShortId` | A short ID for the test run |
        | `success` | Boolean indicating if the run was successful |
        | `run_result` | The test execution result (PASSED, FAILED, SKIPPED). Only set when blocking is true. |
        | `run_status` | The final status of the run (INITIATED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, ERROR, CANCELLED). Only set when blocking is true. |

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Examples">
        Here are some common workflow patterns:

        **Run tests on pull requests:**
        ```yaml
        name: QA.tech Tests
        on:
          pull_request:
            branches: [ main ]

        jobs:
          test:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  blocking: true
        ```

        **Run tests after staging deployment:**
        ```yaml
        name: Deploy to Staging
        on:
          push:
            branches: [ staging ]

        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              # Your deployment steps here

          test:
            needs: deploy
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  blocking: true # Optional, default false
                  test_plan_short_id: 'staging-tests' # Optional
        ```

        **Test preview deployments with environment overrides:**
        ```yaml
        name: Test Preview Deployment
        on:
          pull_request:
            types: [opened, synchronize]

        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            outputs:
              frontend_url: ${{ steps.deploy_frontend.outputs.url }}
              backend_url: ${{ steps.deploy_backend.outputs.url }}
            steps:
              - name: Deploy Frontend
                id: deploy_frontend
                run: |
                  # Your deployment logic here
                  echo "url=https://preview-${{ github.event.number }}-frontend.vercel.app" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

              - name: Deploy Backend
                id: deploy_backend
                run: |
                  # Your deployment logic here
                  echo "url=https://preview-${{ github.event.number }}-backend.vercel.app" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

          test:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            needs: deploy
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  test_plan_short_id: 'your-test-plan-id'
                  blocking: true
                  applications_config: |

                            "name": "PR-${{ github.event.number }}-Frontend"
                          }
                        },
                        "backend-app-id": {
                          "environment": {

                      }
                    }
        ```

        **Multiple test plans with different triggers:**
        ```yaml
        name: Comprehensive Tests
        on:
          schedule:
            - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Daily at 2 AM

        jobs:
          smoke-tests:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  test_plan_short_id: 'smoke-tests'

          regression-tests:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            needs: smoke-tests
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  test_plan_short_id: 'regression-tests'
                  blocking: true
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Direct API Integration">
        If you prefer direct API calls instead of using the GitHub Action, you can use cURL:

        **Basic API usage:**
        ```bash
        curl -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $QATECH_API_TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"testPlanShortId": "your-test-plan-id"}' \
          https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/$QATECH_PROJECT_ID/runs
        ```

        **With application environment overrides:**
        ```bash
        curl -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $QATECH_API_TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "testPlanShortId": "your-test-plan-id",
            "applications": {
              "app-short-id-1": {
                "environment": {
                  "url": "https://preview-123.vercel.app",
                  "name": "Preview Environment"
                }
              }
            }
          }' \
          https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/$QATECH_PROJECT_ID/runs
        ```

        **Response format:**
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "run": {
            "id": "run_abc123",
            "shortId": "abc123",
            "url": "https://app.qa.tech/.../results/abc123",
            "testCount": 5,
            "testPlan": { "id": "...", "name": "..." }
          }
        }
