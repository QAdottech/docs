## GitHub Integration

Automate your QA process by integrating QA.tech with your GitHub workflows. You can trigger test runs automatically after deployments, on pull requests, or any other GitHub event.

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Configure Secrets">
                Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
                
                - `QATECH_API_TOKEN` - Your QA.tech API token
                - `QATECH_PROJECT_ID` - Your QA.tech project ID
                
                You can find these values in your [project settings](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/integrations).
                
                Learn more about [creating secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).
            </Step>
            
            <Step title="Basic Setup">
                Create a new workflow file in your repository at `.github/workflows/qatech.yml`:

                ```yaml
                name: QA.tech Tests
                on:
                  push:
                    branches:
                      - main

                jobs:
                  test:
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                    steps:
                      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                        with:
                          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                          blocking: true
                ```

          This will run all tests in your project whenever code is pushed to the main branch, and the blocking option will make it wait for the result of the run before completing the workflow.

 </Step>

            <Step title="Advanced Setup">
                For more control, you can:

                1. Run specific test plans by adding their IDs:
                ```yaml
                - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                  with:
                    project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                    api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                    test_plan_short_id: 'abc123'
                    blocking: true
                ```

                2. Trigger tests after deployment:
                ```yaml
                name: 'Deploy and Test'
                jobs:
                  deploy:
                    # Your deployment steps here

                  qatech-tests:
                    needs: deploy
                    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                    steps:
                      - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                        with:
                          project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                          api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                          blocking: true
                ```
            </Step>
        </Steps>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Action Options">
        The QA.tech GitHub Action accepts the following inputs:

        | Input | Description | Required | Default |
        |-------|-------------|----------|---------|
        | `project_id` | Your QA.tech project ID | Yes | - |
        | `api_token` | QA.tech API token | Yes | - |
        | `test_plan_short_id` | Test plan short ID to run | No | - |
        | `blocking` | Wait for test results before completing the workflow | No | false |

        The action outputs include:

        | Output | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | `run_created` | Whether the test run was created successfully on QA.tech |
        | `run_short_id` | The short ID of the run. |
        | `run_result` | The test execution result. Only set when blocking is true. |
        | `run_status` | The final status of the run. Only set when blocking is true. |

    <Tab title="Examples">
        Here are some common workflow patterns:

        **Run tests on pull requests:**
        ```yaml
        name: QA.tech Tests
        on:
          pull_request:
            branches: [ main ]

        jobs:
          test:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  blocking: true
        ```

        **Run tests after staging deployment:**
        ```yaml
        name: Deploy to Staging
        on:
          push:
            branches: [ staging ]

        jobs:
          deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              # Your deployment steps here

          test:
            needs: deploy
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: QAdottech/run-action@v2
                with:
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.QATECH_PROJECT_ID }}
                  api_token: ${{ secrets.QATECH_API_TOKEN }}
                  blocking: true # Optional, default false
                  test_plan_short_id: 'staging-tests' # Optional
        ```
    </Tab>
