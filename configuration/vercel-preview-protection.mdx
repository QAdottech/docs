# Vercel Preview Protection Bypass

When testing Vercel preview deployments that are protected with Password Protection, Vercel Authentication, or Trusted IPs, you need to configure QA.tech to bypass these protection mechanisms. This guide shows you how to set up automated testing with Vercel's Protection Bypass for Automation feature.

## Overview

Vercel's Protection Bypass for Automation allows automated tools like QA.tech to access protected deployments using a special secret. This bypasses all deployment protection methods including:

- Password Protection
- Vercel Authentication
- Trusted IP restrictions

## Setting Up Vercel Protection Bypass

### Step 1: Enable Protection Bypass in Vercel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Project Settings">
    Go to your Vercel project dashboard and navigate to **Settings → Deployment
    Protection**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Protection Bypass">
    Find the **Protection Bypass for Automation** section and enable it. This
    will generate a secret token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Secret">
    Copy the generated secret - you'll need this for configuring QA.tech
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The secret is automatically added to your Vercel deployments as the
  environment variable `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`. Regenerating the
  secret will invalidate previous deployments, requiring a redeploy to use the
  new value.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Device Preset in QA.tech

Now you'll configure a device preset in QA.tech to include the bypass headers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Device Presets">
    Go to [**Settings → Device
    Presets**](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/device-presets)
    in your QA.tech project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create or Edit Preset">
    Either create a new device preset or edit an existing one that you'll use
    for Vercel testing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Custom Headers">
    In the preset configuration: - Click **"Custom Headers"** - Add a new header
    with name: `x-vercel-protection-bypass` - Set the value to your Vercel
    secret (the one you copied in Step 1) - Optionally add:
    `x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie` with value `true` for browser-based testing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Preset">
    Click **"Create"** or **"Save"** to save your device preset with the bypass
    headers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Header Configuration Details

### Required Header

- **Header Name**: `x-vercel-protection-bypass`
- **Header Value**: Your generated Vercel secret
- **Purpose**: Bypasses all deployment protection mechanisms
