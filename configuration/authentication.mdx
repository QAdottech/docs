## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication to verify your identity for an extra layer of security to your account in case your password is compromised. In
addition to entering your password, MFA requires you confirm your identity via SMS.

You can enable 2FA under Settings / Authentication

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

QA.tech supports single sign-on to your dashboard via SAML. If you use Google Workspace, we have provider-specific documentation for setting up SSO, but if you use another provider, please contact us!

<Note>
  SSO functionality is available on our enterprise plan. [Contact
  us](https://qa.tech/contact) to learn more!
