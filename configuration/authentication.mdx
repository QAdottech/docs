## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication to verify your identity for an extra layer of security to your account in case your password is compromised. In
addition to entering your password, MFA requires you confirm your identity via SMS.

You can enable 2FA under Settings / Authentication

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

QA.tech supports single sign-on to your dashboard via SAML, including Google Workspace, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and university SSO systems. Your SSO provider must not have CAPTCHA enabled. 2FA works if you configure a Username + Password with 2FA config, though authenticator apps for MFA are not supported.

<Note>
  SSO functionality is available on our enterprise plan. [Contact
