## User Account Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication to verify your identity for an extra layer of security to your QA.tech account in case your password is compromised. In addition to entering your password, MFA requires you confirm your identity via an authenticator app.

You can enable MFA under **Project Settings** → **Profile** → **Authentication**.

<Note>
This MFA setting secures your QA.tech account. For testing applications that require 2FA login, see [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](/best-practices/handle-auth#two-factor-authentication-2fa) in the best practices guide.
