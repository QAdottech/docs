# GitHub App for Automated PR Reviews

Get autonomous AI-powered test coverage and reviews on every pull request. The QA.tech GitHub App analyzes code changes, creates missing tests, and posts comprehensive reviews based on test results.

<Note>
Looking to manually trigger tests from CI/CD workflows? See [GitHub Actions](/configuration/github-actions) instead.
</Note>

## What It Does

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ **Autonomous Testing** | Automatically detects which tests to run based on PR changes |
| ✅ **Test Generation** | Creates missing tests for untested functionality |
| ✅ **Preview Environment Testing** | Tests against PR preview deployments |
| ✅ **Approval/Rejection** | Posts reviews with pass/fail verdicts |
| ❌ **Manual Control** | No control over which tests run (use Actions for that) |
| ❌ **Custom Workflows** | No YAML workflows needed or supported |

**What gets tested:**
- User-facing changes (UI, APIs, business logic accessible through the UI)

**What doesn't get tested:**
- Documentation-only changes
- Infrastructure/CI/CD configurations
- Build tooling updates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    Go to [Settings → Organization → Connections](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/organization/connections) and add the GitHub App connection. Follow the OAuth flow to grant access to your repositories.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Repository Integration">
    Navigate to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/integrations?focus=github-app) and:
    
    - Select the repository you want to enable PR reviews for
    - **Automatic PR reviews are enabled by default** - toggle OFF only if you want to pause reviews
    - (Optional) Add custom review context instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Preview Environments (Optional)">
    If you use GitHub Environments (e.g., from Vercel, Netlify), map them to your QA.tech Applications:
    
    - Click **"Map Environments"** in the integration settings
    - Select which GitHub environment maps to which QA.tech Application
    - Tests will automatically run against the correct preview URL
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Pull Request">
    Once enabled, the agent automatically:
    1. Detects code changes when PRs are opened or updated
    2. Determines which tests are relevant
    3. Creates new tests for untested functionality
    4. Runs all relevant tests against the PR preview
    5. Posts a review with approval or decline based on results
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

### Enable Automatic PR Reviews

Toggle this setting to activate or pause PR reviews without removing the integration.

**Location:** Settings → Integrations → GitHub App → "Enable automatic PR reviews"

### Review Context (Optional)

Add custom instructions that guide how the AI agent reviews your PRs.

**Use cases:**
- Specify areas requiring extra scrutiny
- Provide domain-specific testing guidelines
- Add authentication/setup requirements

**Example:**
```
When testing payment flows, always verify:
- Stripe test mode is active
- Receipt emails are sent
- Transaction appears in admin dashboard
```

**Max length:** 1,024 characters

### Understanding GitHub Deployments

GitHub Deployments are GitHub's native way of tracking when code is deployed to an environment. When your CI/CD deploys a PR, it can create a deployment record that includes the environment name and URL.

**Platforms with automatic GitHub deployment integration:**
- **Vercel** - Creates GitHub deployments automatically for every PR
- **Netlify** - Auto-registers deployments when configured
- **Render, Railway, Fly.io** - Most modern platforms support this

**For other platforms:** You'll need to manually create GitHub deployment records in your CI/CD pipeline. Need help setting this up? Contact us at support@qa.tech.

<Note>
Without GitHub deployments, QA.tech won't know which URL to test your PR against. Environment mapping only works when your CI/CD creates these deployment records.
</Note>

### Environment Mapping (Optional)

Map GitHub deployment environments to QA.tech Applications so tests run against the correct preview URLs.

**When to use:**
- You have multiple Applications (frontend, backend, etc.)
- Your CI/CD creates GitHub deployment environments
- You want tests to run against PR-specific URLs

**How it works:**
1. Your CI/CD deploys a PR and creates a GitHub environment (e.g., "Preview" or "pr-123")
2. QA.tech detects the deployment
3. Tests run using the mapped Application's URL from that environment

## How PR Reviews Work

### Agent Workflow

```
PR opened/updated
  ↓
1. Classify Changes
   → User-facing? Continue
   → Docs/infra only? Skip testing, post info comment
  ↓
2. Assess Coverage
   → Find relevant existing tests
   → Identify gaps in coverage
  ↓
3. Create Tests (if needed)
   → Generate tests for untested functionality
   → Configure dependencies (e.g., login tests)
  ↓
4. Run Tests
   → Execute against PR preview environment
   → Wait for completion
  ↓
5. Post Review
   → ✅ Approve if all tests pass
   → ❌ Decline if tests fail
   → ℹ️ Informational if untestable
```

### Review Format

The agent posts a review with:

- **Verdict:** ✅ Tests passing / ❌ Tests failing / ℹ️ Unable to verify
- **What was tested:** Description of coverage in prose
- **Results summary:** Patterns and themes from test outcomes
- **Test details:** Automatic table with individual test results

**What reviews DON'T include:**
- Code quality opinions
- Implementation suggestions
- References to other bot comments

## Best Practices

**Deploy with Vercel or Netlify**

These platforms automatically create GitHub deployments, making PR testing seamless. No additional configuration needed - just connect your repository and every PR gets tested automatically.

**Build a regression test suite**

As your PR tests pass, promote them to a regression test plan. This creates a growing suite of real-world tests that catch regressions automatically on future PRs.

**Let QA.tech test PRs first**

Configure PR reviews to run before requesting human code review. This catches functional issues early, so reviewers can focus on code quality instead of manually testing features.

**Use review context for your domain**

Add domain-specific testing guidelines in the review context (e.g., "Always verify email notifications are sent" or "Check mobile responsiveness"). The agent will incorporate these into its testing approach.

**Test in parallel with human review**

Run both QA.tech and human reviews simultaneously. The agent handles functional testing while humans review code architecture - best of both worlds.

## Troubleshooting

### PR reviews aren't posting

**Check:**
- [ ] GitHub App installed and granted repository access
- [ ] Repository integration configured in QA.tech
- [ ] "Enable automatic PR reviews" toggle is ON
- [ ] PR has user-facing changes (not docs/infra only)

### Tests running against wrong URL

**Solutions:**
- Map your GitHub environments to Applications (Settings → Integrations → GitHub App → Map Environments)
- Verify your CI/CD creates GitHub deployment environments
- Check that environment names match between GitHub and QA.tech

### Agent created irrelevant tests

**Solutions:**
- Add review context with specific testing guidelines
- Update existing tests to cover the functionality better
- The agent learns from your existing test patterns

### Review says "Unable to verify through end-to-end testing"

**This is expected for:**
- Documentation-only changes (.md, .txt, README)
- Infrastructure changes (CI/CD, Docker, deployment scripts)
- Build configuration (package.json without functional changes)

**The agent can only test changes accessible through the UI.**

## Limitations

- **No manual test selection:** Agent autonomously decides which tests to run
- **Requires preview deployments:** Cannot test without accessible PR environment
- **UI-testable changes only:** Backend-only microservices without UI access can't be tested
- **No workflow customization:** Unlike GitHub Actions, there's no YAML configuration

## Need Manual Control?

If you need to:
- Choose specific test plans to run
- Trigger tests from custom CI/CD steps
- Control test execution timing

Use [GitHub Actions](/configuration/github-actions) instead, or use both for comprehensive coverage.
