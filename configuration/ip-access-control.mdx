## Overview

QA.tech's automated testing appears as bot traffic to CDNs and firewalls. To prevent blocking, you need to configure your CDN or firewall to allow traffic from QA.tech's IP addresses.

QA.tech uses a dedicated pool of static IP addresses (through NAT) for all test runs and agent sessions. This means you can whitelist these IPs in any security system that makes IP-based decisions.

## QA.tech IP Addresses

Find the current list of QA.tech IP addresses:

- **In the app:** [**Settings → Network**](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/network)
- **Direct access:** https://app.qa.tech/api/outbound-ips

<Warning>
IP addresses may change. Always use the current list from [Settings → Network](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/network) or the API endpoint above.
</Warning>

## What IP Whitelisting Enables

Whitelisting QA.tech's IP addresses allows your tests to:

- **Bypass CAPTCHA challenges** - Works with Google reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile, and other CAPTCHA services that use IP reputation scoring
- **Bypass rate limiting** - Avoid IP-based throttling or blocking
- **Access IP-restricted resources** - Allow QA.tech through firewall rules or IP allowlists
- **Reduce bot detection false positives** - Prevent security tools from flagging legitimate test traffic

## Cloudflare Configuration

### Recommended: AI Crawl Control

Cloudflare's [AI Crawl Control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/) is designed for managing automated traffic like QA.tech testing.

**Setup approach:**
1. Identify QA.tech traffic in your AI Crawl Control dashboard (look for requests from QA.tech IP ranges during test execution)
2. Create allow rules for QA.tech traffic patterns
3. Monitor and adjust as needed

**Why this works best:** Automatically manages bot traffic with built-in analytics and zero configuration for most users.

### Alternative: WAF IP Rules

If you need traditional IP whitelisting:

1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to Security → WAF → Tools → IP Access Rules
3. Add QA.tech IP addresses to the allowlist
4. Set action to "Allow"

For detailed steps, see [Cloudflare's WAF documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/).

## AWS CloudFront Configuration

CloudFront blocking typically involves geographic restrictions, AWS WAF Bot Control, or signed URLs.

**Common solutions:**
- **AWS WAF Bot Control:** Add QA.tech IP ranges to your bot control allow rules
- **Geographic restrictions:** Ensure QA.tech's operating regions aren't blocked
- **Signed URLs/cookies:** Contact QA.tech support for integration guidance

For detailed AWS setup, see [AWS WAF Bot Control documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/features/bot-control/).

## Other CDNs and Firewalls

For other CDN providers or firewall systems, add QA.tech IP addresses to your allow/whitelist rules.

The exact steps depend on your security provider, but the concept is the same across all platforms:

1. **Get QA.tech's IP addresses** from [Settings → Network](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/network) or via https://app.qa.tech/api/outbound-ips
2. **Add them to your security tool's IP allowlist/whitelist**
3. **Configure the rule** to bypass security checks (CAPTCHA, rate limiting, etc.) for these IPs

**Common platforms that support IP whitelisting:**
- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Google Cloud Armor
- Azure Front Door / Application Gateway
- Imperva / Incapsula
- Akamai
- Sucuri
- Wordfence (WordPress)
- Most enterprise firewalls and CDNs

Consult your security provider's documentation for specific instructions on IP allowlisting.

## Troubleshooting

**Still seeing 403 errors or captcha challenges?**

1. **Verify IP addresses are current** – QA.tech IPs may change; check [Settings → Network](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/network)
2. **Check rate limiting rules** – QA.tech tests may trigger rate limits before allow rules apply
3. **Review geographic restrictions** – Ensure no blanket blocks on QA.tech's operating regions
4. **Wait for propagation** – CDN changes take 5-10 minutes to propagate globally
5. **Test after changes** – Run a simple test to verify your configuration

**Need help?** Contact QA.tech support with your CDN provider and error details.
