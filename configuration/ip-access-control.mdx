## Whitelisting IPs on Cloudflare to Avoid Captcha

When using Cloudflare with your application, you may encounter captcha challenges for your automated tests or agents. To prevent this, you can whitelist our agent IPs on Cloudflare.

### Creating a WAF Rule for IP Whitelisting

You can create a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule to whitelist specific IPs:

1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to the Security section
3. Select WAF > Tools > IP Access Rules
4. Add the agent IPs to the allowlist

For more details, see the [Cloudflare documentation on IP Access Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/).

### Finding Agent IPs

You can always find the current agent IPs in the application:

1. Go to Settings > Network in the app
2. Copy the listed IP addresses to use in your Cloudflare WAF rules

Whitelisting these IPs will ensure your automated processes can interact with your application without being blocked by captcha challenges.
