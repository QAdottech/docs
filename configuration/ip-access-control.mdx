## Whitelisting

To permit traffic originating from QA.tech you need to add our IP addresses to your firewall rules. This process is called whitelisting, and is usually done by your security team.

## QA.tech IP range

The current list of IPs that you need to whitelist can be found logged in to [QA.tech](https://app.qa.tech) under Configuration - Network.

Or by accessing https://app.qa.tech/api/outbound-ips

## Whitelisting IPs on Cloudflare to Avoid Captcha

When using Cloudflare with your application, you may encounter captcha challenges for your automated tests or agents. To prevent this, you can whitelist our agent IPs on Cloudflare.

### Creating a WAF Rule for IP Whitelisting

You can create a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule to whitelist specific IPs:

1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to the Security section
3. Select WAF > Tools > IP Access Rules
4. Add the agent IPs to the allowlist

For more details, see the [Cloudflare documentation on IP Access Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/).

### Finding Agent IPs

You can always find the current agent IPs in the application:

1. Go to Settings > Network in the app
2. Copy the listed IP addresses to use in your Cloudflare WAF rules

Whitelisting these IPs will ensure your automated processes can interact with your application without being blocked by captcha challenges.

## Whitelisting IPs for Other Security Providers

QA.tech uses a dedicated pool of static IP addresses (through NAT) for all test runs and agent sessions. This means you can whitelist these IPs in any security system that makes IP-based decisions.

### What IP Whitelisting Enables

Whitelisting QA.tech's IP addresses allows your tests to:

- **Bypass CAPTCHA challenges** - Works with Google reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile, and other CAPTCHA services that use IP reputation scoring
- **Bypass rate limiting** - Avoid IP-based throttling or blocking
- **Access IP-restricted resources** - Allow QA.tech through firewall rules or IP allowlists
- **Reduce bot detection false positives** - Prevent security tools from flagging legitimate test traffic

### Configuring Other Security Providers

The exact steps depend on your security provider, but the concept is the same across all platforms:

1. **Get QA.tech's IP addresses** from Settings > Network in the app or via https://app.qa.tech/api/outbound-ips
2. **Add them to your security tool's IP allowlist/whitelist** 
3. **Configure the rule** to bypass security checks (CAPTCHA, rate limiting, etc.) for these IPs

**Common platforms that support IP whitelisting:**
- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Google Cloud Armor
- Azure Front Door / Application Gateway
- Imperva / Incapsula
- Akamai
- Sucuri
- Wordfence (WordPress)
- Most enterprise firewalls and CDNs

Consult your security provider's documentation for specific instructions on IP allowlisting.
