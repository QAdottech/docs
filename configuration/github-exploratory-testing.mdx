<Warning>
**Private Beta** - This feature is currently in private beta. Request access by emailing daniel@qa.tech
</Warning>

Trigger deep exploratory testing on any pull request by mentioning `@qatech` in a PR comment. The AI agent analyzes your changes, discovers functionality gaps, creates tests, and provides detailed feedback.

<Note>
This is different from [automatic PR reviews](/configuration/github-app). Exploratory testing is on-demand and focuses on discovering issues through interactive testing, while automatic reviews run on every PR.
</Note>

## How It Works

Mention `@qatech` anywhere in a PR comment:

```
@qatech please test the new payment flow
```

The agent will:
1. **Analyze changes** - Examines PR diff and crawls the preview deployment
2. **Check coverage** - Identifies which existing tests apply
3. **Create tests** - Generates new tests for untested functionality
4. **Run tests** - Executes relevant tests against the PR preview
5. **Post review** - Writes a detailed GitHub review with findings

## When to Use It

| Use Exploratory Testing | Use Automatic PR Reviews |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Deep investigation of complex changes | Every PR as standard gating |
| Interactive testing with custom instructions | Hands-off automated coverage |
| Specific areas need thorough validation | General functional regression |
| Debugging test failures | Consistent baseline testing |

**Example use cases:**
- "Test the entire checkout flow with different payment methods"
- "Explore what happens when users upload large files"
- "Check if the new search handles edge cases"
