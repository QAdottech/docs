## What is QA.tech?

QA.tech combines the speed and repeatability of automated testing with the flexibility and intelligence of human testers. Our AI agents can:

- **Understand natural language instructions** - Write tests in plain English
- **Adapt to application changes** - Automatically adjust to UI updates
- **Find edge cases** - Discover issues humans might miss
- **Scale infinitely** - Run tests 24/7 without fatigue

### How AI Agents Work

Our AI agents understand your application like a human would, but with perfect memory and infinite patience. They can:

- Navigate complex user flows
- Handle dynamic content and changing interfaces
- Adapt to different data scenarios
- Find and report issues automatically

### Knowledge Graph Technology

We build a comprehensive understanding of your application by analyzing:

- Page structure and navigation
- User interaction patterns
- Data flows and dependencies
- Common user journeys

## Key Benefits

### For Development Teams

- **Faster feedback cycles** - Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Reduced manual testing** - Focus on creative testing scenarios
- **Better test coverage** - AI agents explore more paths than scripts
- **Continuous testing** - Run tests on every deployment

### For QA Teams

- **Eliminate repetitive tasks** - Focus on strategic testing
- **Improve test quality** - AI agents find unexpected issues
- **Scale testing capacity** - Handle more features with same resources
- **Better bug reports** - Detailed reproduction steps automatically

### For Organizations

- **Reduce testing costs** - 70% less manual effort required
- **Improve release confidence** - Comprehensive test coverage
- **Faster time to market** - Automated testing accelerates delivery
- **Better user experience** - Catch issues before users do

## How It Works

### 1. AI Agent Testing

Our AI agents use advanced computer vision and natural language processing to:

- **Visual Understanding** - See and interact with UI elements like humans
- **Natural Language Processing** - Understand test instructions in plain English
- **Adaptive Behavior** - Learn from each test run and improve over time
- **Intelligent Navigation** - Find the best paths through your application

### 2. Knowledge Graph System

We build a digital representation of your application that includes:

- **Page Relationships** - How pages connect and flow together
- **Element Context** - Understanding of UI components and their purposes
- **User Journey Patterns** - Common paths users take through your app
- **Data Dependencies** - How information flows between different parts

### 3. Test Generation Engine

Our system automatically creates tests by:

- **Analyzing User Flows** - Understanding typical user journeys
- **Identifying Critical Paths** - Finding the most important functionality
- **Generating Test Cases** - Creating comprehensive test scenarios
- **Optimizing Coverage** - Ensuring all features are tested

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A web application to test (publicly accessible or with proper authentication)
- Basic understanding of testing concepts
- Access to your application's URL and credentials (if required)

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Navigate to [app.qa.tech](https://app.qa.tech) and create your account. You'll receive immediate access to the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First Project">
    Add your application URL and basic configuration. Our system will automatically analyze your application structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Test">
    Use our suggested tests or create a custom test using natural language. Watch AI agents navigate your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Examine detailed test reports with screenshots, videos, and step-by-step analysis of any issues found.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What You'll See

When you run your first test, you'll observe:

- **Real-time Navigation** - Watch AI agents move through your application
- **Intelligent Interactions** - See how they handle forms, buttons, and dynamic content
- **Detailed Reporting** - Get comprehensive results with visual evidence
- **Issue Detection** - Automatic identification of problems and edge cases

## Core Concepts

### AI Agent Testing

Unlike traditional script-based testing, AI agents can:
