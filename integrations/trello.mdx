The Trello integration allows you to manually export QA.tech issues to your Trello board. Issues are **not automatically synced** - you choose which issues to send to Trello.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** QA.tech automatically detects issues during test runs. You can set up the integration without any issues, but you'll need at least one detected issue before you can export. See [Issues](/core-concepts/issues) to learn what types of issues are detected.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Trello">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations** in your project settings. Click **"Manage Connections"** at the top, then add the Trello integration. Follow the OAuth flow to grant QA.tech access to your Trello workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Project">
    Return to **Settings → Integrations** and click on the Trello integration. Select the **Trello board** and **list** where you want exported cards to appear, then click **"Save Trello Settings"**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Issues

Once configured, you can export any QA.tech issue to Trello:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Issues">
    Click **Issues** in the sidebar to see detected issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an Issue">
    Click on an issue to view its details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    In the **Link** section, click **"Create task"**. A card will be created in your configured Trello list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Exported

When you export an issue, Trello receives:

- **Card Title:** The issue title from QA.tech
- **Description:** Full issue details with a link back to QA.tech

<Tip>
  Exported cards include a direct link back to QA.tech, so your team can easily access test results and occurrence details.
