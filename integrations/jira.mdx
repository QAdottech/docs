The Jira integration allows you to manually export QA.tech issues to your Jira board. Issues are **not automatically synced** - you choose which issues to send to Jira.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** QA.tech automatically detects issues during test runs. You need at least one detected issue before you can export. See [Issues](/core-concepts/issues) to learn what types of issues are detected.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Jira">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations** in your project settings. Click **"Manage Connections"** at the top, then add the Jira integration. Follow the OAuth flow to grant QA.tech access to your Jira instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Project">
    Return to **Settings → Integrations** and click on the Jira integration. Select the **Jira project** and **issue type** where you want exported issues to appear, then click **"Save Jira Integration"**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Issues

Once configured, you can export any QA.tech issue to Jira:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Issues">
    Click **Issues** in the sidebar to see detected issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an Issue">
    Click on an issue to view its details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    In the **Link** section, click **"Create ticket"**. The issue will be created in your configured Jira project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Exported

When you export an issue, Jira receives:

- **Summary:** The issue title from QA.tech
- **Description:** Full issue details including type, first seen date, and help information
- **Labels:** `qatech` label for easy filtering
- **Link:** Direct URL back to the issue in QA.tech

<Tip>
  Exported issues include a direct link back to QA.tech, so your team can easily access test results and occurrence details.
