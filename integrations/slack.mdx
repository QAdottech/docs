# QA.tech Slack Bot

The QA.tech Slack Bot brings AI-powered testing assistance directly into your Slack workspace, allowing your team to create test cases, report bugs, and get QA guidance without leaving Slack.

## What It Does

**Smart AI Assistant**: Mention `@QA.tech` in any channel to get intelligent QA assistance powered by advanced AI.

**Test Case Generation**: Describe a feature or bug, and the bot will suggest comprehensive test cases that you can review and add to your QA.tech project.

**Bug Reporting & Investigation**: Report bugs in natural language and get suggested test cases to reproduce the issue and prevent regressions.
