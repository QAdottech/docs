The Microsoft Teams integration allows you to receive test run notifications directly in your Teams channels using incoming webhooks. Get notified when test runs complete, with details about pass/fail status and failed tests.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Workflow in Microsoft Teams">
    In Microsoft Teams, right-click on the channel where you want to receive notifications, then select **Workflows** from the menu.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/teams-channel-menu.png" alt="Microsoft Teams channel menu showing the Workflows option" />
    </Frame>

    Select the **"Post to a channel when a webhook request is received"** template. This creates a workflow that posts messages to your channel when it receives a webhook request.

    Once the workflow is created, you'll see a dialog with a webhook URL. Copy this URL - you'll need it for the next step.

    <Tip>
      For detailed instructions on creating incoming webhooks in Microsoft Teams, see [Microsoft's official documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498).
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure in QA.tech">
    Go to [**Settings → Integrations**](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/integrations) in your QA.tech project. Find the **Microsoft Teams** section and paste the webhook URL you copied from Teams.

    Click **Save** to enable the integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Get

Each notification includes:

- **Run status** - Pass or fail indication
- **Test plan name** - If the run was part of a test plan
- **Timing** - When the run started and total duration
- **Failed tests** - Breakdown of any failed tests
- **Results link** - Direct link to the full test report in QA.tech

You'll receive a notification for every completed run, whether triggered manually, through CI/CD, or via schedule.

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing

- Verify the webhook URL is correct and hasn't expired
- Check that the workflow in Microsoft Teams is still active
- Ensure the channel still exists and the workflow has permission to post

### Need to update the webhook URL

If you need to regenerate or change your webhook URL:

1. Open the Workflows app in Microsoft Teams
2. Find your webhook workflow and select **Edit**
3. Expand the trigger **"When a Teams webhook request is received"** to copy the URL
4. Update the URL in QA.tech under **Settings → Integrations**
