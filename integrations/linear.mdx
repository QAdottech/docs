The Linear integration allows you to manually export QA.tech issues to your Linear workspace. Issues are **not automatically synced** - you choose which issues to send to Linear.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** QA.tech automatically detects issues during test runs. You can set up the integration without any issues, but you'll need at least one detected issue before you can export. See [Issues](/core-concepts/issues) to learn what types of issues are detected.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Linear">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations** in your project settings. Click **"Manage Connections"** at the top, then add the Linear integration. Follow the OAuth flow to grant QA.tech access to your Linear workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Project">
    Return to **Settings → Integrations** and click on the Linear integration. Select the **Linear Team** where you want exported issues to appear, then click **"Save Linear Integration"**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Issues

Once configured, you can export any QA.tech issue to Linear:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Issues">
    Click **Issues** in the sidebar to see detected issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an Issue">
    Click on an issue to view its details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    In the **Link** section, click **"Create issue"**. The issue will be created in your configured Linear team.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Exported

When you export an issue, Linear receives:

- **Title:** The issue title from QA.tech
- **Description:** Includes:
  - Issue type
  - First seen date
  - Issue description
  - Help/hint information (if available)
  - Link back to QA.tech
  - Console error details (for console errors: error level, file location, line numbers, messages)

<Tip>
  Exported issues include a direct link back to QA.tech, so your team can easily access test results and occurrence details.
