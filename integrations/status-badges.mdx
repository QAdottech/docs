# Status Badges

Status badges are visual indicators that show the current state of your QA tests. They automatically update whenever new tests are run, providing real-time feedback on your project's quality.

## What are Status Badges?

Status badges display the current status of your QA tests in a simple, visual format. They can indicate whether tests are passing, failing, or were skipped based on your most recent test run.

## Test Plan Integration

Status badges work seamlessly with test plans. You can:

- Create separate badges for different test plans
- Track the health of specific workflows or features
- Monitor critical paths independently from other tests
- Set up dedicated badges for development, staging, and production environments
