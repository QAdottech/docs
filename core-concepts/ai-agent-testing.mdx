QA.tech uses specialized AI agents to test your application like humans would, but faster and more thoroughly. Our system automatically routes testing tasks to the right agent based on context—no manual configuration needed.

## Our AI Agent System

| Agent | Purpose | How It Activates | Learn More |
|:------|:--------|:-----------------|:-----------|
| **Chat Assistant** | Interactive testing, test creation, project analysis | You start a conversation | [AI Chat Assistant](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) |
| **PR Review** | Autonomous testing of every pull request | Automatic on PR open/update | [GitHub App](/configuration/github-app) |
| **Explorative** | Deep on-demand testing with custom instructions | `@qatech` mention in PR comments | [GitHub Actions](/configuration/github-actions) |
| **Test Generation** | Creates test cases from requirements | Via Chat Assistant | [AI Chat Assistant](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) |
| **Onboarding** | First-time setup and baseline test coverage | Via Chat Assistant | [AI Chat Assistant](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) |

## How It Works in Practice

Here's what happens when you open a PR that changes your checkout flow:

**1. Automatic Detection**
```
PR opened: "Add Apple Pay to checkout"
→ PR Review agent activates
```

**2. Change Classification**
```
Analyzing diff...
├─ checkout.tsx: USER-FACING ✓
├─ payment-methods.ts: USER-FACING ✓
└─ README.md: DOCS ONLY ✗

Classification: USER-FACING changes detected
```

**3. Coverage Assessment**
```
Existing tests found:
├─ "Complete checkout with credit card" ✓
├─ "Complete checkout with PayPal" ✓
└─ Apple Pay integration: NOT COVERED ⚠️
```

**4. Test Generation**
```
Creating new test:
"Complete checkout flow with Apple Pay"
├─ Add item to cart
├─ Navigate to checkout
├─ Select Apple Pay as payment method
├─ Verify payment confirmation
└─ Verify order appears in account
```

**5. Execution & Review**
```
Running against PR preview environment...
✅ All tests passing (3/3)

Posting GitHub review:
"✅ Tests passing - Apple Pay integration verified"
```

This entire workflow runs autonomously—no human intervention required.

## When to Use AI Agents vs Scripts

| Scenario | AI Agents | Scripts | Manual QA |
|:---------|:----------|:--------|:----------|
| **Exploratory testing** | ✅ Best - discovers edge cases through varied behavior | ❌ Fixed paths only | ✅ Good - but slow and expensive |
| **Regression testing** | ✅ Good - handles UI changes gracefully | ✅ Best - fastest execution | ❌ Too repetitive |
| **Exact same steps every time** | ⚠️ Possible but overkill | ✅ Best - fully deterministic | ❌ Error-prone over time |
| **Testing multiple user flows** | ✅ Best - tries different approaches automatically | ⚠️ Need separate script per variant | ✅ Good - but doesn't scale |
| **Complex calculations** | ❌ Use assertions in code instead | ✅ Best - precise math | ⚠️ Manual calculation prone to errors |
| **Form filling with realistic data** | ✅ Best - understands context | ⚠️ Need hardcoded test data | ✅ Good - but tedious |
| **Testing preview environments** | ✅ Best - [automatic PR reviews](/configuration/github-app) | ⚠️ Need CI/CD integration | ❌ Requires manual coordination |
| **First-time test coverage** | ✅ Best - [onboarding agent](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) sets up quickly | ❌ Requires upfront investment | ⚠️ Slow to establish baseline |

In practice, most teams use a combination: AI agents for exploration and edge cases, scripts for critical deterministic flows, and manual QA for subjective evaluation (design, UX, brand consistency).

## Agent Coordination

Agents automatically hand off tasks to specialists when needed:

**Chat → Test Generation**
```
You: "Create 5 tests for the checkout flow"
→ Chat Assistant routes to Test Generation agent
→ Analyzes your application structure
→ Creates tests prioritizing revenue-critical paths
```

**Chat → Explorative**
```
You: "Test this pull request"
→ Chat Assistant routes to Explorative agent
→ Fetches PR details and preview environment
→ Runs tests and posts review
```

**PR Review → Test Generation**
```
PR detected with untested functionality
→ PR Review agent requests new tests
→ Test Generation creates coverage
→ PR Review executes and reports
```

You don't manage this coordination—it happens automatically based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## Getting Started

**For Interactive Testing:**
Open the [Chat Assistant](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) in your project dashboard and start asking questions or requesting tests.

**For Automatic PR Testing:**
Install the [GitHub App](/configuration/github-app) and select repositories to enable automatic reviews on every PR.

**For On-Demand PR Testing:**
Set up [GitHub Actions integration](/configuration/github-actions) and mention `@qatech` in PR comments when you want deep exploratory testing.
