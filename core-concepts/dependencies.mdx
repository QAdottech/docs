Test dependencies define relationships between your tests, controlling execution order and enabling browser state reuse.

## Dependency Types

### Wait For
Test waits for dependency to complete before starting. Browser state is not transferred, but output data from the dependency test is passed to the dependent test session.

### Resume From  
Test reuses browser state (login sessions, cookies, etc.) from dependency if completed successfully within the last hour. If dependency is older or failed, test waits for dependency to run first.

## Multiple Dependencies

Configure multiple dependencies using both "Wait For" and "Resume From" relationships. If any dependency fails, all dependent tests are skipped in the current run.

## Examples

### Resume From Example
**Tests:**
1. **Login Test** (creates logged-in session)
2. **Create Order Test** (resumes from Login Test)  
3. **View Dashboard Test** (resumes from Login Test)

**Execution:**
- If Login Test completed successfully within 1 hour: Create Order and View Dashboard start immediately with saved login session
- If Login Test is older or failed: Login Test runs first, then dependent tests start with fresh login session

### Wait For Example
**Tests:**
1. **Create Team Test** (creates team, outputs team name)
2. **Add User to Team Test** (waits for Create Team Test)

**Execution:**
- Create Team Test runs first and creates "Marketing Team"
- Add User to Team Test receives "Marketing Team" as input data and uses it during execution

## State Optimization

Resume From dependencies automatically use state optimization when:

✅ Dependency completed successfully within last hour  
✅ Same environment  
✅ Valid browser state

State preserved includes:
- Login sessions and cookies
- Local storage data
- Session storage data
- All browser state from dependency test

## Failure Behavior

When any dependency fails:
- All dependent tests are skipped
- Test run continues with other independent tests
- Failed dependency must be fixed and re-run

## Best Practices

**Use Resume From when:**
- Tests need login sessions or browser state
- Optimizing test execution time
- Dependencies create persistent state

**Use Wait For when:**
- Tests need fresh browser state
- Dependencies create data that subsequent tests need (team names, user IDs, etc.)
- Sequential execution required without browser state transfer
