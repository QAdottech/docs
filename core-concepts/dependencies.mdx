Test dependencies define relationships between your tests, controlling execution order and enabling browser state reuse.

## Dependency Types

### Wait For
Test waits for dependency to complete before starting. Browser state is not transferred, but output data from the dependency test is passed to the dependent test session.

### Resume From  
Test reuses browser state (login sessions, cookies, etc.) and output data from dependency if completed successfully within the last 6 hours. If dependency is older or failed, test waits for dependency to run first.

## Multiple Dependencies

Configure multiple dependencies using both "Wait For" and "Resume From" relationships. If any dependency fails, all dependent tests are skipped in the current run.

## Examples

### Resume From Example
**Tests:**
1. **Login Test** (creates logged-in session)
2. **Create Order Test** (resumes from Login Test)  
3. **View Dashboard Test** (resumes from Login Test)

**Execution:**
- If Login Test completed successfully within 6 hours: Create Order and View Dashboard start immediately with saved login session
- If Login Test is older or failed: Login Test runs first, then dependent tests start with fresh login session

### Wait For Example
**Tests:**
1. **Create Team Test** (creates team, outputs team name)
2. **Add User to Team Test** (waits for Create Team Test)

**Execution:**
- Create Team Test runs first and creates "Marketing Team"
- Add User to Team Test receives "Marketing Team" as input data and uses it during execution

## State Optimization

Resume From dependencies automatically use state optimization when:

✅ Dependency completed successfully within last 6 hours  
✅ Same environment  
✅ Valid browser state

State preserved includes:
- Login sessions and cookies
- Local storage data
- Session storage data
- All browser state from dependency test

## Application and Environment Constraints

Dependencies work between tests in the same project, but browser state cannot transfer across different domains due to browser security restrictions.

### What Works vs. What Doesn't

| ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Supported |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Tests in same application, different environments | Browser state (cookies, sessions) across different domains |
| Output data (IDs, names) passed between any tests | Resume From dependencies expecting login transfer across domains |
| Wait For dependencies between different applications | Login session reuse from `app.example.com` to `admin.example.com` |
| Sequential execution across applications | Cookie-based authentication across different URLs |

### Cross-Application Workflows

When testing workflows spanning multiple applications or services:

**Use Wait For dependencies:**
- Tests execute sequentially without browser state transfer
- Output data (user IDs, team names) passes between tests
- Each test starts with fresh browser state on its application URL

**Example:**
```
Test 1: Create User (frontend.example.com) → outputs userId  
Test 2: Verify User (admin.example.com) → waits for Test 1, receives userId
```

**Don't use Resume From across different domains:**
- Browser sessions don't transfer between different domains
- Login cookies are domain-specific
- Will fail with authentication errors

<Note>
  **Why this happens:** Browser security prevents cookies and sessions from transferring across different domains. Each application needs its own authentication test if using Resume From dependencies.
</Note>

## Failure Behavior

When any dependency fails:
- All dependent tests are skipped
- Test run continues with other independent tests
- Failed dependency must be fixed and re-run

## Best Practices

**Use Resume From when:**
- Tests need login sessions or browser state
- Optimizing test execution time
- Dependencies create persistent state

**Use Wait For when:**
- Tests need fresh browser state
- Dependencies create data that subsequent tests need (team names, user IDs, etc.)
- Sequential execution required without browser state transfer
