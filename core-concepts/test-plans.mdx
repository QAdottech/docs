## Overview

Test Plans are collections of test cases that you want to run together regularly. This feature provides flexibility in running tests through multiple methods: API triggers, scheduled runs, or manual execution through the UI.

Test plans help streamline your testing process by:

- Organizing related test cases into logical groups
- Enabling automated execution on schedules
- Supporting API-driven test automation
- Managing test dependencies efficiently

## Creating a Test Plan

1. Navigate to the Test Plans section
2. Click the "Create Test Plan" button in the top right
3. Provide the following information:
   - Name: A clear, descriptive name for your test plan
   - Description (optional): Additional context about the test plan's purpose
4. Click "Save" to create your test plan

## Adding Test Cases to a Test Plan

When adding test cases to a test plan, keep in mind:

- Dependencies will be automatically included in runs, even if not visible in the UI
- Consider creating separate plans for:
  - Frequently run core tests
  - Less frequent tests that run on a schedule

## Execution Methods

### Github Actions Integration

You can automate test execution by integrating Test Plans with your GitHub workflows. This integration allows you to:

Trigger tests automatically after deployments
Run tests on pull requests
Execute tests on any GitHub event

Read more how to setup [Github Actions](/configuration/github).

### API Execution

Test Plans can be triggered programmatically through the API. For detailed information about available endpoints and parameters, refer to the [API reference documentation](/api-reference/start-the-tests).

### Scheduled Execution

You can configure Test Plans to run automatically at specific times or intervals:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Test Plans">
    Go to [Test Plans](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/test-plans)
    in your project dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Test Plan">
    Click on the test plan you want to schedule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Schedules">
    Click on **Manage Schedules** within the test plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Schedule">
    Add your cron schedule expression and a description, then click **Add
    Schedule**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### UI Execution

To run a Test Plan manually:

1. Navigate to the Test Plans section
2. Locate your Test Plan
3. Click the "Run Tests" button

## Performance & Parallel Execution

QA.tech automatically runs tests in parallel to minimize total execution time when executing test plans:

- **Automatic parallelization**: Tests run concurrently by default when executing a test plan, significantly reducing the time required to complete a full test suite
- **Dependency-aware**: Parallel execution respects the dependency graph, ensuring dependent tests run in the correct order while maximizing parallelization opportunities
- **Auto-scaling**: The system automatically scales up to approximately 100 concurrent agents based on demand, with no manual configuration required
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Independent tests execute simultaneously while dependent tests wait for their prerequisites to complete

This means that while a single test case may take several minutes to execute, running a test plan with multiple independent test cases will complete much faster than running them sequentially. For example, 20 independent tests that each take 3 minutes would complete in approximately 3 minutes when run as a test plan, rather than 60 minutes if run sequentially.

<Tip>
  To maximize parallel execution benefits, organize your test cases to minimize
  dependencies between tests. The more independent tests in your test plan, the
  more parallelization can occur. Learn more about [Test
  Dependencies](/core-concepts/dependencies) and [Creating
  Tests](/best-practices/creating-tests).

## Best Practices

1. **Optimize Test Organization**:

   - Group related test cases together
   - Create separate plans for different testing frequencies
   - Keep plans focused and maintainable

2. **Dependency Management**:

   - Be aware that dependent test cases will be included automatically
   - Review dependencies when setting up new test plans

3. **Schedule and Workflow Optimization**:
   - Schedule less frequent tests during off-peak hours
   - Configure GitHub workflows to run tests at key points in your development process (deployments, PRs, merges)
