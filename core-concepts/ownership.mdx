Test ownership lets you assign team members to specific test cases and test plans. This helps organize testing responsibilities, track your work through a dedicated dashboard, and filter tests by owner.

Ownership is optional - tests can remain unassigned or be assigned to any organization member.

## Assigning Owners

### To Test Cases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Test Case">
    Navigate to the test case you want to assign and click to open the edit
    page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Owner Section">
    In the sidebar, click the **Advanced** tab to expand advanced settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Owner">
    In the **Owner** section, select a team member from the dropdown. Choose "No
    owner" to remove an existing assignment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Save the test case to apply the ownership change.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Ownership is saved with each test case revision. When you update a test case,
  the owner assignment carries forward to the new revision.
</Note>

### To Test Plans

You can assign an owner when creating a test plan or update it afterward:

**During creation:** In the "Add Test Plan" modal, select an owner from the optional "Owner" field.

**After creation:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Test Plan">
    Navigate to the test plan from the Test Plans page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Click the **Settings** tab within the test plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Owner">
    In the **Owner** section, select a team member or choose "No owner" to
    remove the assignment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Assignment

When creating multiple tests at once using the "Add Tests" modal, you can assign the same owner to all tests. Expand the **Advanced** section in the modal to find the Owner field.

### Where to Assign

| Where              | When to Use                     | Notes                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Test case editor   | Setting owner for existing test | Can update anytime in Advanced tab |
| Test plan creation | Assigning owner during setup    | Optional field in creation modal   |
| Test plan settings | Changing owner after creation   | Update in Settings tab             |
| Bulk test creation | Same owner for multiple tests   | Set in Advanced section of modal   |

## My Items Dashboard

The **My Items** tab on your project dashboard provides a focused view of everything you own.

**Location:** Project dashboard → **My Items** tab

| Widget               | Shows                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test execution trend | Pass/fail trend chart for your owned tests over time            |
| Recent failures      | Up to 5 recent failures with direct links to results            |
| My test plans        | List of test plans you own (up to 50) with run status           |
| My test cases        | List of test cases you own (up to 50) with enabled/draft badges |

Each widget links directly to the relevant test or result page, making it easy to investigate issues or review your tests.

<Note>
  When you don't own any tests or test plans, the dashboard shows empty states
  with guidance on assigning ownership.
</Note>

## Filtering by Owner

On the test cases page, you can filter to show only tests you own:

1. Click the **Filters** dropdown above the test list
2. Check the **Owned by me** checkbox
3. The list updates to show only test cases where you are the owner

This filter combines with other filters (status, applications, etc.) and persists across sessions. The URL also updates, so you can share filtered views with your team.

<Tip>
  Filtering by owner is useful during sprint planning to focus on your team's
  tests, or when reviewing tests you're responsible for maintaining.
</Tip>

## Common Patterns

### Feature Team Ownership

**Scenario:** A team owns specific feature areas.

Assign test cases to the team member responsible for that feature. Use the "My Items" dashboard to track your feature's test health and filter by owner during standups.

### Developer-Owned Tests

**Scenario:** Developers create and maintain tests for their features.

Assign ownership when creating tests via [AI Chat](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) or the test modal. Developers can use "Owned by me" filter to review their tests before deployments.

### QA Team Organization

**Scenario:** QA team distributes test maintenance across members.

Assign test plans to QA engineers. Use the execution trend chart in "My Items" to identify tests needing attention and track pass rates over time.

## Best Practices

1. **Assign Clear Ownership**:
   - Set owners when responsibilities are defined
   - Update ownership when team structure changes
   - Leave tests unowned if ownership is unclear

2. **Use the Dashboard Effectively**:
   - Review "My Items" regularly to track your testing workload
   - Act on recent failures shown in the widget
   - Monitor execution trends to identify flaky tests

3. **Combine with Other Features**:
   - Use owner filtering during sprint planning
   - Assign owners to [test plans](/core-concepts/test-plans) for organized test management
   - Filter by owner when reviewing test results

<Tip>
  Ownership works best when it reflects actual team structure. If you're unsure
  who should own a test, leave it unassigned until responsibilities are clear.
