## What types of issues does QA.tech detect?

We continuously improve our issue detection and can export issues to Linear, Jira, and Trello. Some examples of issues we detect:

### Failed tests

When a test cannot be completed, we create a failed test issue. This often indicates a UX problem or functional issue in your application that needs investigation.

### Console errors

We capture JavaScript console errors that occur during test execution. These are typically filed as low-severity issues but can indicate bugs or misconfigurations.

### Accessibility issues

We automatically check for WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 violations using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) on every page your tests visit.

#### How it works

- Scans run automatically during test execution (on page load, after navigation, after clicks)
- Issues appear in the dashboard with the exact URL, HTML element, and WCAG documentation
- Same issue across multiple test runs is grouped together

#### WCAG coverage

- ✅ WCAG 2.0 (Level A, AA, AAA)
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 (Level A, AA)
- ✅ WCAG 2.2 (Level AA)

#### Limitations

- Maximum 10 issues captured per test session ([see limits](/core-concepts/limits))
- Color contrast not checked (use browser DevTools for this)
- Content in iframes not scanned
- Certain rules disabled: `region`, `landmark-one-main`

**To maximize coverage:** Create tests that visit all important pages in your app. Tests provide deeper coverage than crawlers because they can authenticate, fill forms, and navigate complex flows.

<Note>
  Accessibility scans are integrated into test execution. To schedule regular accessibility checks, create a test plan and schedule it to run daily/weekly.
</Note>

### What we don't detect

Because we interact with your product as a user through a browser:

- **Server-side errors:** Use a monitoring tool like Sentry or BugSnag for backend exceptions
- **Network request failures:** We log these for debugging but don't create issues for them

## Issue Statuses

You can mark issues as resolved or choose to ignore them to not be notified again.

Ignored issues do not count towards your statistics and insights.

## Export Issues

Issues can easily be exported to Linear, Jira, or Trello. Configure integrations in [Settings → Integrations](/integrations/linear).
