## What types of issues does QA.tech detect?

QA.tech automatically detects issues during test runs. You can export any detected issue to Linear, Jira, or Trello.

- **Failed tests** - When a test cannot be completed, QA.tech creates a failed test issue. This often indicates a UX problem or functional issue in your application that needs investigation.

- **Console errors** - QA.tech captures JavaScript console errors that occur during test execution. These are typically filed as low-severity issues but can indicate bugs or misconfigurations.

- **Accessibility issues** - QA.tech automatically checks for WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 violations using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) on every page your tests visit.

#### How it works

- Issues are created automatically when tests fail during execution
- Same issue across multiple test runs is grouped together using fingerprint-based deduplication
- Issues appear in the dashboard with details about when and where they occurred

#### WCAG coverage

- WCAG 2.0 (Level A, AA, AAA)
- WCAG 2.1 (Level A, AA)
- WCAG 2.2 (Level AA)

#### Limitations

**Accessibility scanning:**

- Maximum 10 issues captured per test session ([see limits](/core-concepts/limits))
- Color contrast not checked (use browser DevTools for this)
- Content in iframes not scanned
- Certain rules disabled: `region`, `landmark-one-main`

**What we don't detect:**

Because we interact with your product as a user through a browser:

- **Server-side errors:** Use a monitoring tool like Sentry or BugSnag for backend exceptions
- **Network request failures:** We log these for debugging but don't create issues for them

<Note>
  **Automatic scanning:** Accessibility checks run automatically whenever you execute a test - no setup needed.

**Schedule regular checks:** To get ongoing accessibility monitoring, create a [test plan](/core-concepts/test-plans) with your test cases and add a schedule (daily, weekly, etc.), or run tests from your [CI/CD pipeline](/configuration/ci-cd-integration).

</Note>

## How Issues Are Collected

Issues are automatically detected and created during test runs. You don't need to manually create or report issues.

### Automatic Detection

When a test execution completes with a **FAILED** result, QA.tech automatically:

1. Creates an issue record for the failed test
2. Links the issue to the specific test case and run
3. Groups similar issues together using fingerprint-based deduplication

### Deduplication

QA.tech uses a fingerprint system to group similar issues together:

- Each issue has a unique fingerprint based on the test case and project
- If the same test fails across multiple runs, it creates one issue with multiple occurrences
- This prevents duplicate issues and helps you track how often a problem occurs

### When Issues Are Created

- **After test execution:** Issues are created automatically when a test finishes with a FAILED result
- **Requires test run:** Issues are only created for actual test runs (not during initial test generation)
- **One issue per test case:** Each unique test case failure creates one issue, with multiple occurrences tracked over time

## Issues Dashboard

### Filtering Issues

Use filters to find specific issues:

| Filter       | Options                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Severity** | Minor, Major, Critical                                               |
| **Type**     | Accessibility, Console, Failed Test, Hosting                         |
| **Status**   | Active, Ignored, Resolved (by default, only Active issues are shown) |

You can also use the search bar to find issues by title or description.

### Insights Dashboard

Issues also appear in the **Insights** page with date range filtering:

- **Issues header stats:** Shows the count of new issues and issue occurrences within the selected date range
- **New Issues table:** Displays active issues that were created during the selected time period
- **Date filtering:** Use the date range picker to view issues from specific time periods

The Insights dashboard provides a quick overview of issues trends, while the full Issues page offers complete management capabilities.

### Viewing Issue Details

Click on any issue to see:

- **Severity and Status** - How critical the issue is and its current state
- **First/Last Seen** - When the issue was first and most recently detected
- **Occurrences** - Every time this issue was encountered during test runs, including which test run and URL
- **Help Information** - Guidance on how to fix the issue (accessibility issues include WCAG documentation links)

## Export to Issue Trackers

QA.tech integrates with popular issue tracking tools so you can manage bugs in your existing workflow. Issues are **not automatically synced** - you choose which issues to export.

### Supported Integrations

| Integration                    | What Gets Created | Configuration                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Jira](/integrations/jira)     | Jira Issue        | Select project and issue type |
| [Linear](/integrations/linear) | Linear Issue      | Select team                   |
| [Trello](/integrations/trello) | Trello Card       | Select board and list         |

### How to Export an Issue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Issues">
    Click **Issues** in the sidebar to see all detected issues for your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Your Issue">
    Use filters to narrow down by severity, type, or status. Search for specific
    issues by title.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Issue Details">
    Click on an issue to view its full details, occurrences, and help
    information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export to Your Tracker">
    In the issue detail view, find the **Link** section at the top. Click the
    export button for your configured integration: - **"Create Issue in Jira"**
    - Creates a Jira issue with `qatech` label - **"Create Issue in Linear"** -
    Creates a Linear issue in your team - **"Create Card in Trello"** - Creates
    a Trello card in your list
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you see **"Add Integration"** instead of export buttons, you need to
  configure an integration first. Go to **Settings → Integrations** in your
  project to set up Jira, Linear, or Trello.
</Note>

### What Gets Exported

When you export an issue, QA.tech sends:

- **Title:** The issue title from QA.tech
- **Description:** Issue type, first seen date, full description, and help hints
- **Link:** Direct URL back to the issue in QA.tech for easy reference
- **Console Details:** For console errors, includes the error level, file location, and messages

<Tip>
  After exporting, the issue detail page shows a direct link to the created
  ticket, so you can quickly jump to it in Jira, Linear, or Trello.
