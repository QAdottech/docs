## What types of issues does QA.tech detect?

We are continusly improving our issue detection. Some examples of issues we detect are:

**UX issues**
If we can't complete a task due to the UI or UX being non-functional, we mark it as a UX issue. This reflects an issue you most likely need to investigate to improve the user experience of your product.

**Network issues**
We keep track of all the failed network requests that occurred during the test execution. This could reflect rate limit errors or environment/API configuration issues.

**Accessibility issues**

We automatically check for WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 violations using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) on every page your tests visit.

**How it works:**

- Scans run automatically during test execution (on page load, after navigation, after clicks)
- Issues appear in the dashboard with the exact URL, HTML element, and WCAG documentation
- Same issue across multiple test runs is grouped together

**Coverage:**

- ✅ WCAG 2.0 (Level A, AA, AAA)
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 (Level A, AA)
- ✅ WCAG 2.2 (Level AA)

**Limitations:**

- Maximum 10 issues captured per test session ([see limits](/core-concepts/limits))
- Color contrast not checked (use browser DevTools for this)
- Content in iframes not scanned
- Certain rules disabled: `region`, `landmark-one-main`

**To maximize coverage:** Create tests that visit all important pages in your app. Tests provide deeper coverage than crawlers because they can authenticate, fill forms, and navigate complex flows.

<Note>
  Accessibility scans are integrated into test execution. To schedule regular accessibility checks, create a test plan and schedule it to run daily/weekly.
</Note>

**Console errors**
Console errors are usually filed as low-severity issues.

Because we interact with your product as a user, through a browser, we do not detect issues and exceptions happening server-side. For this, we recommend using a monitoring tool such as BugSnag or Sentry.

## Issue Statuses

You can mark issues as resolved or choose to ignore them to not be notified again.

Ignored issues do not count towards your statistics and insights.

## Export Issues

Issues can easily be exported to your ticket system of choice. Connect it under the Configuration tab.
