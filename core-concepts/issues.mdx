## What types of issues does QA.tech detect?

We are continusly improving our issue detection. Some examples of issues we detect are:

**UX issues**
If we can't complete a task due to the UI or UX being non-functional, we mark it as a UX issue. This reflects an issue you most likely need to investigate to improve the user experience of your product.

**Network issues**
We keep track of all the failed network requests that occurred during the test execution. This could reflect rate limit errors or environment/API configuration issues.

**Accessibility issues**
We automatically run the [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) suite of accessibility checks on every page we visit.

**Console errors**
Console errors are usually filed as low-severity issues.

Because we interact with your product as a user, through a browser, we do not detect issues and exceptions happening server-side. For this, we recommend using a monitoring tool such as BugSnag or Sentry.

## Issue Statuses

You can mark issues as resolved or choose to ignore them to not be notified again.

Ignored issues do not count towards your statistics and insights.

## Export Issues

Issues can easily be exported to your ticket system of choice. Connect it under the Configuration tab.
