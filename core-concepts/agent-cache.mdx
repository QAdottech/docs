Agent Cache is **enabled by default** for all tests. It stores AI reasoning from successful test runs and reuses those decisions when your pages haven't changed - making subsequent runs faster.

## Why It's On by Default

Caching makes your tests **faster**. Each AI reasoning step takes 2-5 seconds - with caching enabled, those decisions are reused instantly when your pages haven't changed.

For stable pages - admin dashboards, settings screens, checkout flows - caching delivers significant speed improvements with no trade-offs.

## How It Works

When a test runs, the AI analyzes each page, decides what action to take, and executes it. With caching enabled, these reasoning decisions are stored and reused on subsequent runs:

```
Without Cache                      With Cache
─────────────────                  ─────────────────
1. Analyze page                    1. Check cache
2. AI decides action      →        2. Cache hit? Use stored decision
3. Execute action                  3. Execute action
4. Repeat...                       4. Repeat...
```

**What gets cached:** AI reasoning decisions - which element to click, what text to type, how to navigate.

**What still executes:** All browser actions (clicks, typing), screenshots, page loads, and verification steps run normally every time.

**Cache invalidation:** The system automatically detects when page content changes significantly and fetches fresh AI decisions. Failed test runs never save to cache, preventing "bad" reasoning patterns from persisting.

## When to Disable Agent Cache

<Tip>
  Most users never need to disable caching. Consider turning it off only when
  debugging flaky tests or testing brand-new features where you want fresh AI
  analysis every run.
</Tip>

## How to Disable Agent Cache

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open test case editor">
    Navigate to **Test Cases**, select a test, and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Settings tab">
    In the sidebar, click the **Settings** tab (not "Steps").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Agent Cache section">
    Scroll down to locate the **Agent Cache (BETA)** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable caching">
    Uncheck **Enable caching for this test** and save your changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  Agent Cache is in BETA. While cache entries automatically invalidate when page
  content changes significantly, some minor UI updates may be missed.
</Warning>

- **Page content affects hit rate** - Cache keys include visible page content, so pages with dynamic elements will naturally see lower hit rates
- **30-day expiration** - Unused cache entries expire after 30 days
- **Only successful runs cache** - Failed tests never store decisions
