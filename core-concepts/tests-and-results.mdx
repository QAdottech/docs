## Scenarios

Scenarios are groups of test cases that belong together. They are best organized around user flows, such as:

- Login
- Product Search
- Add to shopping cart
- Checkout
- Notification Settings

Each scenario should optimally include both positive and negative test cases. For example, a "Checkout Process" scenario might include:

- Successful purchase with valid payment details
- Order completion with fedex shipping
- Payment attempt with expired credit card (negative case)
- Checkout with empty cart (negative case)

This structure helps ensure comprehensive testing of each user flow, including both expected successes and potential failure points.

### Negative Testing

Negative testing is a QA practice that validates how a system handles invalid inputs, unexpected user behavior, and error conditions. Think of it as "testing what shouldn't work" to ensure the application fails gracefully and securely.

- Validating error messages
- Ensuring system stability under incorrect usage
- Preventing security vulnerabilities
- Maintaining data integrity

## Tests and Test Runs

Every time a test run is triggered, we run the selected scenarios. The result is a test run with one or more test cases in it.

## Filtering and Searching Results

When viewing test run results, you can quickly find specific tests using filters and search:

- **Filter by result** — Show only PASSED, FAILED, or SKIPPED tests
- **Filter by status** — Filter tests by execution state (INITIATED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, ERROR, CANCELLED)
- **Search by name** — Find specific tests using the search box

<Note>
**Result vs. Status**: A test's _result_ is the outcome after completion (PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED), while _status_ tracks the execution state. For example, a test can have STATUS=COMPLETED with RESULT=FAILED.
</Note>

All filters persist in the URL, making it easy to share specific views with your team.
