## What are Configs?

Configs are reusable pieces of data that can be accessed across multiple tests. They're commonly used for:

- Login credentials
- Email addresses
- File uploads

### Adding a New Config

1. Navigate to Settings » Configs
2. Click "Add config"
3. Select a template
4. Fill in required fields
5. Save your configuration

### Using Configs in Tests

Configs can be referenced in your test cases under the Settings » Configs section. When creating or editing a test, you can select which configs the test should use.

### System-Provided Configs

QA.tech automatically provides several configs for common testing needs:

1. **Single-use Test Email Address**

   - Generates a unique email for each test session
   - Perfect for email verification flows
   - Includes access to email inbox

2. **Magic Link Login Email**

   - Format: `magic-login-xxxxx@qatech.email`
   - Dedicated for magic link authentication flows
   - Includes inbox monitoring

3. **Project Email Address**
   - Format: `prj-xxxxx@qatech.email`
   - Project-specific email address
   - Permanent address for your project

### Creating Custom Configs

1. **Username + Password Credentials**

   - For standard authentication
   - Fields: Username (can be email) and password
   - Optional "Use for Basic Auth" checkbox for HTTP Basic Authentication

   <Accordion title="When to enable Basic Auth">
     The "Use for Basic Auth" checkbox is for **HTTP Basic Authentication**, which is different from regular login forms.
     
     **Enable this when your tests need to access:**
     - Staging or testing environments protected with browser authentication popups
     - URLs that trigger browser dialogs asking for username/password
     - Corporate proxies or internal tools requiring basic authentication
     - Password-protected development environments
     
     When enabled, QA.tech automatically supplies these credentials to the browser whenever it encounters an HTTP Basic Auth challenge, so your tests can proceed without manual intervention.
     
     <Note>
       **Important:** This is for the HTTP Basic Authentication protocol (RFC 7617), not for testing login forms on your website. For regular login forms, create a Username + Password config and leave "Use for Basic Auth" disabled.
     </Note>
   </Accordion>

2. **Username + Password with 2FA**

   - For two-factor authentication flows
   - Includes 2FA setup (Google Authenticator/Authy)

3. **Valid Email + Password Login**

   - Includes generated unique email
   - Password management
   - Email inbox access

4. **File Upload**
   - Upload static files for testing
   - Maximum size: 250MB
   - Supports common file formats
