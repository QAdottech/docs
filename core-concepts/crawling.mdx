# Crawling Sessions

Crawling sessions help QA.tech learn about your application by exploring pages and interactions. This improves test suggestions and agent performance.

## Overview

Manual crawling allows you to explore specific areas of your application. Use this when:

- Launching new features
- Needing focused exploration (e.g., admin panels, checkout flows)
- Updating navigation or UI structure
- Improving test coverage for critical user journeys

Navigate to [**Settings → Crawling**](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/crawling) to access the Crawling Sessions page.

## Configuration

### Output State (Optional)

Resume from a test case's final browser state. Useful for:

- Crawling authenticated areas (use a login test's output state)
- Exploring flows requiring specific setup

### Start URL

The URL where crawling begins (e.g., `https://app.example.com`).

### Maximum Depth

How many link levels deep to crawl from the start URL.

- **0**: Only the starting page
- **1**: Starting page + directly linked pages
- **2+**: Progressively deeper exploration

**Range**: 0-10
**Default**: 1

### Maximum Actions

Maximum number of interactions (clicks, navigations) during the session.

**Range**: 1-1,000
**Default**: 300

### Crawling Intent (Optional)

Describe what to focus on (up to 500 characters). The crawler prioritizes actions matching your intent.

**Examples**:

- `Focus on login and authentication flows`
- `Explore product catalog and filtering options`
- `Crawl admin panel and user management`

## Understanding Results

### Session Status

- **Processing**: Currently running
- **Complete**: Successfully finished
- **Failed**: Encountered an error
- **Cancelled**: Manually stopped

### Iteration Details

Each crawling iteration shows:

- **Screenshot**: Visual capture of the page
- **Source Action**: How the crawler reached this page ("n/a" for start page)
- **Depth**: Links away from start URL (0 = start page)
- **Found Actions**: Interactive elements discovered (links, buttons, forms)
- **Intent Score**: Relevance to your goal (0-40% low, 41-70% moderate, 71-100% high)

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Clear intents work better (❌ "Crawl everything" → ✅ "Focus on e-commerce checkout flow")
- **Use output states**: Chain a login test to explore authenticated areas
- **Review results**: Check screenshots and intent scores to verify exploration

## Troubleshooting

**Crawl Failed**

- Requires authentication → Use output state from login test
- Pages not accessible or SSL issues
