# Testing with AI Agents

QA.tech is revolutionizing how web applications are tested by combining the best parts of automated testing—speed, repeatability, and scalability—with the intelligence and adaptability of human testers.

## The QA.tech Approach

### Traditional Testing Limitations

Traditional automated testing relies on rigid scripts that:

- **Break with UI changes** - Any modification to selectors or page structure requires script updates
- **Limited to predefined scenarios** - Can only test exactly what was scripted
- **High maintenance burden** - Require constant updates as applications evolve
- **Poor handling of dynamic content** - Struggle with modern web applications
- **Expensive to scale** - Each new test requires manual scripting

### AI Agent Testing Advantages

Our AI agents overcome these limitations by:

- **Adapting to changes automatically** - Learn and adjust to UI modifications
- **Exploring beyond predefined paths** - Discover edge cases and unexpected scenarios
- **Understanding context** - Comprehend the purpose and relationships of UI elements
- **Continuous learning** - Improve test strategies based on results and feedback
- **Natural language instructions** - Create tests using plain English descriptions

## Core Architecture
