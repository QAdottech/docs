QA.tech combines AI agents with traditional testing infrastructure to handle web application testing at scale. This section explains the core concepts behind the platformâ€”from how AI agents work, to managing test data, environments, and integrations.

## What you'll learn

**AI & Testing Fundamentals** - How AI agents execute tests, when they're more effective than scripts, and how the [Chat Assistant](/core-concepts/ai-chat-assistant) coordinates specialized testing agents.

**Test Management** - How to organize [test cases](/core-concepts/tests-and-results), use [test plans](/core-concepts/test-plans) for grouping, manage [dependencies](/core-concepts/dependencies) between tests, and track results.

**Knowledge & Context** - How the [knowledge graph](/core-concepts/knowledge-graph) learns your application's structure and how the [knowledge base](/core-concepts/knowledge) stores domain-specific information to improve test quality.

**Environments & Configuration** - Managing [applications and environments](/core-concepts/applications-and-environments), handling [preview environments](/core-concepts/preview-environments) for PR testing, and storing credentials in [configs](/core-concepts/configs).

**Workflow Integration** - Connecting with GitHub for [automated PR reviews](/configuration/github-app), tracking [issues](/core-concepts/issues) from test failures, and setting up [notifications](/core-concepts/notifications).

Start with [AI Agent Testing](/core-concepts/ai-agent-testing) to understand the foundation, then explore the topics most relevant to your workflow.
