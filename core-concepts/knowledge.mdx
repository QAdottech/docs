QA.tech's knowledge system helps AI assistants understand your project better by providing three types of context: knowledge items, global context, and auto-generated summaries.

## Knowledge Items

Add documentation, links, and text content that AI assistants can reference when chatting and generating tests. This knowledge is searchable and helps provide accurate, project-specific context.

### What You Can Add

- **URLs**: Link to documentation sites, help pages, API docs
- **Text Content**: Add custom instructions, project notes, or guidelines

### How It's Used

Knowledge items are automatically searched when:

- Chatting with AI assistants about your project
- Generating new test cases
- Getting project-specific help and recommendations

The AI uses semantic search to find relevant information from your knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

### Adding Knowledge Items

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Settings">
    Navigate to [**Settings →
    Knowledge**](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/knowledge).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Knowledge">
    Click **"Add Knowledge"** to create a new knowledge item.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Content Type">
    Choose your content type (URL, or Text) based on what you want to add.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Details">
    Fill in the title and content for your knowledge item.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Process">
    Save to process and index the content for use by AI assistants.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Global Context

Global context gets included in the AI agent's prompt for **all tests** in your project. Use this to specify project-specific behaviors, requirements, or guidelines that help the agent perform better.

### What to Include

The global context should contain information that the AI agent should be aware of when executing any test:

- **Service Description**: "The service is a route planning service for American railways"
- **Data Requirements**: "When creating users, always use Swedish names"
- **Quality Standards**: "Always fail tests when obvious typos are found"
- **UI Guidelines**: "If a button is red, it should never be clicked"
- **Authentication Flows**: "Login requires 2FA via SMS"

### Best Practices

- Keep it concise but specific
- Focus on universal rules that apply to all tests
- Include domain-specific terminology and behaviors
- Mention any unusual UI patterns or interactions

For detailed examples and guidelines, see [Project Context Best Practices](/best-practices/project-context).

## Project Summary

An AI-generated summary of your website's functionality and structure based on analysis of your pages and user interactions. This automatically provides context to help AI assistants understand your project better.

### How It Works

1. **Page Analysis**: QA.tech analyzes your website's structure and functionality
2. **Graph Generation**: Creates a knowledge graph of your site's features and flows
3. **AI Summary**: Generates a comprehensive summary using the graph data
4. **Automatic Updates**: Refreshes as your site changes and more analysis is completed

### What's Included

The summary typically contains:

- Overview of your platform's purpose and main functionality
- Key features and user flows
- Important pages and their purposes
- Integration points and external services

### Refreshing the Summary

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Settings">
    Navigate to [**Settings →
    Knowledge**](https://app.qa.tech/current-project/settings/knowledge).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Project Summary">
    Find the **"Project Summary"** section on the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh Summary">
    Click **"Refresh"** to generate an updated summary based on your latest site
    analysis.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The summary requires initial site analysis to be completed. If no summary
  appears, ensure you've run some tests or site analysis first.
</Note>

## Knowledge in Chat

When using QA.tech's chat feature, the AI assistants automatically:

1. **Search Knowledge Items**: Find relevant documentation and custom content
2. **Apply Global Context**: Use project-specific guidelines and requirements
3. **Reference Summary**: Understand your site's overall structure and purpose

This provides more accurate, project-specific responses when asking about:

- How to test specific features
- Best practices for your type of application
- Troubleshooting test issues
- Understanding test results

## Knowledge in Test Generation

When generating new tests, AI assistants use your knowledge to:

- **Understand Requirements**: Apply global context rules and guidelines
- **Reference Documentation**: Find relevant testing scenarios from your docs
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Check against existing test patterns
- **Suggest Improvements**: Recommend tests based on your documented flows

## Managing Knowledge

### Organization Tips

- **Use Clear Titles**: Make knowledge items easy to find and understand
- **Keep Content Current**: Regularly update documentation links
- **Remove Outdated Info**: Delete or update knowledge that's no longer relevant
- **Test Your Knowledge**: Ask the chat assistant questions to verify knowledge quality

### Troubleshooting

**Knowledge not being found in chat:**

- Ensure content has been fully processed (check status indicators)
- Try different search terms or questions
- Verify the content is relevant to your question

**Global context not being applied:**

- Check that you've saved the global context settings
- Verify the context applies to the type of test you're running
- Review test results to see if context guidelines are being followed

**Summary not generating:**

- Ensure you've completed initial site analysis
- Try running a few tests to build the knowledge graph
- Manually refresh the summary after adding new functionality
