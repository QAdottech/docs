QA.tech uses a hierarchical structure of **applications** and **environments** to organize your testing infrastructure and provide context-aware test execution.

A single project may have one or more _applications_.

## Applications

An **application** represents a single app that you want to test. It serves as a container for relevant test cases and environments. Each application has at least one _environment_, which contains properties (e.g., the URL) used by test cases within the application.

### Creating Applications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to applications settings">
    Go to [**Settings →
    Applications**](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/applications)
    in your project dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new application">
    Click the "Add Application" button and fill in the required details
    including name, color, icon, and default environment information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save application">
    Click "Create Application" to save your application with its associated
    environment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environments

**Environments** represent different configurations of your application where tests can be executed. A single environment may contain various properties (like the website URL to test) which will be used by the agent when executing a test case. For example, you may have different environments for different language versions of your app.

### Creating Environments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Environment Settings">
    Navigate to [**Settings →
    Environments**](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/environments)
    in your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new environment">
    Click "Add Environment" and fill in the environment details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select application">
    Choose which application this environment belongs to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment">
    Fill in the rest of the environment details as prompted in the form.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Structure

```
Project
├── Frontend
│   ├── Environment A (Development)
│   ├── Environment B (Staging)
│   └── Environment C (Production)
├── Admin app
│   ├── Environment D (Test)
│   └── Environment E (Production)
└── API
    └── Environment F (Development)
```

## Environment Selection

When creating a new test, you must assign it to an existing application. Executing a single test will use that application's _default_ environment by default, unless specified otherwise in the session overrides.

You can run tests in different environment configurations by adding them to a _test plan_ and selecting target environments in the test plan settings.

## Best Practices

### Application Organization

- Create separate applications for different systems or services
- Use descriptive names that reflect the application's purpose
- Group related functionality under the same application

### Environment Management

- Maintain consistent naming conventions across environments
- Use clear, descriptive URLs for each environment
- Keep environment URLs up to date as deployments change

## Use Cases

### Multi-Service Products

For products with multiple services (e.g., user frontend, admin site, etc), you can:

- Create separate applications for each service
- Test service interactions across different environments

### Feature Branch Testing

- Create _preview_ environments for feature branches
- Test new features in isolated environments
- Clean up preview environments after feature completion

This hierarchical structure helps you organize your testing infrastructure efficiently while maintaining clear separation between different applications and their configurations.
