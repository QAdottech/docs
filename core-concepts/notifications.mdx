You can get a Slack notification and/or weekly email summaries for the entire team.

## Notification Types

| Type | Delivery | Timing | Content |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Run Completion | Slack | When run finishes (1+ tests) | Pass/fail status, duration, failed test details |
| Weekly Summary | Email | Mondays 6 AM CET | Test statistics, pass rate, time saved, suggestions |

## Slack Notifications

### Setup

Configure Slack notifications in two steps:

1. **Connect Slack** at Organization Settings → Connections
2. **Select channel** at Project Settings → Integrations → Slack

Each project has a default Slack channel configured in project settings. By default, all run notifications go to this channel. However, when triggering runs via the API, you can override the notification destination on a per-run basis to send notifications to different channels or multiple channels. See [Per-Run Notification Overrides](#per-run-notification-overrides) below for details.

### What You Get

Each notification includes:

- **Run status** - Pass or fail with color coding
- **Test plan name** - If run was part of a test plan
- **Timing** - When started and total duration
- **Failed tests** - Detailed breakdown with clickable links
- **Results link** - Direct access to full test report

You'll receive a notification for every completed run, whether you trigger it manually, through CI/CD, or via schedule.

### Per-Run Notification Overrides

When triggering test runs via the [Start Run API](/api-reference/start-run), you can override the default Slack channel and send notifications to specific channels for that run. This is useful for:

- **PR-specific channels**: When testing a pull request, send notifications to a dedicated Slack channel for that PR (e.g., `#pr-123-frontend-tests`) instead of the default project channel
- **Team-specific notifications**: Route test results to team-specific channels (e.g., send frontend test results to `#frontend-team` and backend tests to `#backend-team`) so each team only sees relevant notifications
- **Failure-only channels**: Set up channels that only receive notifications when tests fail (e.g., `#alerts-critical-failures`), reducing noise while ensuring failures are immediately visible

**How it works:**

Include a `notifications` array in your API request to specify which Slack channels should receive notifications for that run:

```json
{
  "testPlanShortId": "abc123",
  "notifications": [
    { "type": "slack", "channel": "C0478ABCDEF", "notifyOn": "always" },
    { "type": "slack", "channel": "C0123FAIL42", "notifyOn": "failure" }
  ]
}
```

**Key points:**

- Each channel can be configured with `notifyOn: "always"` (default) to receive both start and finish notifications, or `notifyOn: "failure"` to only receive finish notifications when the run result is not `PASSED` (i.e., `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, or `null`)
- When overrides are provided, the default project channel is skipped - only the specified channels receive notifications
- The QA.tech bot must already have access to all channels you specify
- Requires [Slack integration](/core-concepts/notifications#slack-notifications) to be configured for the project

For complete API documentation, see the [Start Run API Reference](/api-reference/start-run#slack-notification-overrides).

## Email Reports

Weekly reports provide a summary of testing activity and quality metrics to all organization members.

**When**: Every Monday at 6 AM Central European Time  
**Who**: All organization members  

### What You Get
- Tests executed count
- Pass percentage
- Time saved estimate
- Suggested new tests to add
- Summary of test runs

**Unsubscribe**: Use the unsubscribe link in the email footer individually.

## Triggering Runs from CI/CD

Tests triggered via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or direct API automatically send notifications when complete. This keeps your team informed regardless of how tests are started.
