## Notification Types

| Weekly Summary | Email | Mondays 6 AM CET | Test statistics, pass rate, time saved, suggestions |

## Slack Notifications

### Setup

Configure Slack notifications in two steps:

1. **Connect Slack** at Organization Settings → Connections
2. **Select channel** at Project Settings → Integrations → Slack

Each project can send notifications to one public Slack channel. You get one notification per run of the testing suite.

### What You Get

Each notification includes:

- **Run status** - Pass or fail with color coding
- **Test plan name** - If run was part of a test plan
- **Timing** - When started and total duration
- **Failed tests** - Detailed breakdown with clickable links
- **Results link** - Direct access to full test report

You'll receive a notification for every completed run, whether you trigger it manually, through CI/CD, or via schedule.

## Email Reports

Weekly reports provide a summary of testing activity and quality metrics to all organization members.

**When**: Every Monday at 6 AM Central European Time  
**Who**: All organization members  

### What You Get
- Tests executed count
- Pass percentage
- Time saved estimate
- Suggested new tests to add
- Summary of test runs

**Unsubscribe**: Use the unsubscribe link in the email footer individually.

## Triggering Runs from CI/CD

Tests triggered via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or direct API automatically send notifications when complete. This keeps your team informed regardless of how tests are started.
