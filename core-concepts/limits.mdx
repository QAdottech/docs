# Limits

QA.tech implements rate limits to ensure system stability and optimal performance during test execution. These limits prevent excessive resource consumption and ensure consistent test behavior.

## Default Limits

Each test execution has the following limits per default:

| Type                 | Default Limit | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Console logs         | 100           | Maximum number of console log entries captured per session  |
| Network requests     | 1000          | Maximum number of network requests captured per session     |
| Accessibility issues | 10            | Maximum number of accessibility issues captured per session |

## What Happens When a Limit is Reached

When a limit is reached:

1. A warning message is logged indicating the limit has been reached
2. Further events of that type are not captured or stored
3. Test execution continues normally without additional event collection of the limited type

For example, if your application generates 150 console logs, only the first 100 will be captured and displayed in the test results.

## Customizing Limits

If your testing needs require higher limits, we can increase these on request. Contact our support team to discuss your requirements.

<Note>
  Increasing rate limits may impact test performance and result in larger test
  reports. We'll work with you to find the optimal balance for your specific
  needs.

## Best Practices

To work effectively with rate limits:

1. **Filter unnecessary logging**: Reduce verbose console logging in test environments
2. **Split complex tests**: Break tests with many interactions into smaller, focused test cases
