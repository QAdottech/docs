## Default Test Files

QA.tech provides two default test files that are available for all tests:

- **cat.pdf** - A simple PDF document for testing PDF uploads
- **cat.jpg** - A standard image file for testing image uploads

These files are automatically available to the AI agent during test execution.

## Custom File Uploads

For testing specific file import features or custom file requirements, you can create file upload configs. Custom files are stored in Supabase storage and made available to the agent during test execution.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Configs">
    Go to **Settings → Configs** in your project dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create File Upload Config">
    Click **Add config** and select **File Upload**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your File">
    In the File Upload field, click to upload or drag and drop your test file (max 250MB)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Enter a config name and click **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Test Case">
    Edit your test case, go to **Settings → Configs**, and select your file upload config
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Custom Files Work

When a test runs with a file upload config:

1. **File input elements**: When the agent clicks a file input (`<input type="file">`), a custom file chooser UI appears showing:
   - Your custom uploaded files from configs
   - Default test files (cat.pdf, cat.jpg) if no custom files match
   - Files are automatically filtered based on the input's `accept` attribute

2. **File selection**: The agent selects a file from the chooser UI, and the file is uploaded to your application

3. **File storage**: Custom files are stored in Supabase storage and downloaded to the browser session when needed

### Supported File Types

**Any file type is supported** - there are no MIME type or file extension restrictions. The File Upload config accepts files of any type up to 250MB in size. During test execution, files are filtered based on the HTML input element's `accept` attribute, so the agent will only use files that match your application's input restrictions.

### File Selector

Using javascript we catch the event that triggers a file selector and renders a custom file selector. This allows us to upload files from configs.

### Drag and Drop

The agent supports drag-and-drop file uploads for dropzone elements using the `selectFile` tool. When the agent encounters a dropzone (an element that accepts drag-and-drop events), it can dispatch a `drop` event with the file data.

**Current limitations:**
- Drag-and-drop support is currently limited to the default test files (cat.pdf, cat.jpg)
- Custom file uploads from configs work through file input elements (click to trigger the file chooser UI), not via drag-and-drop
- If you need to test drag-and-drop with custom files, use file input elements instead of dropzones

### File Type Restrictions

When your application has input restrictions (e.g., only accepting .csv files), our AI agent will automatically:

- Read the `accept` attribute from the HTML input element
- Filter available files to match the allowed MIME types, wildcards (e.g., `image/*`), or file extensions
- Only present files that match your application's restrictions in the file selector

This filtering ensures the agent only uses compatible files, even though the File Upload config accepts any file type.
