## Default Test Files

QA.tech provides two default test files that are available for all tests:

- **test.pdf** - A simple PDF document for testing PDF uploads
- **test.jpg** - A standard image file for testing image uploads

These files are automatically available to the AI agent during test execution.

## Custom File Uploads

For testing specific file import features or custom file requirements, you can create file upload configs:

1. Navigate to Settings Â» Configs
2. Select "File Upload" type
3. Upload your test file (max 250MB)
4. Save the configuration
5. Edit the test case, add the config under "Settings"

### File Selector

Using javascript we catch the event that triggers a file selector and renders a custom file selector. This allows us to upload files from configs.

### Drag and Drop

The agent currently does not support drag-and-drop file uploads. You can still test by clicking the drag and drop area to trigger the file selector.

### File Type Restrictions

When your application has input restrictions (e.g., only accepting .csv files), our AI agent will automatically:

- Detect the allowed file types from the input element
- Only use files that match the allowed extensions
