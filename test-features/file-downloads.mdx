## Testing File Downloads

QA.tech's agent can test file download functionality in your web applications. When a file download is triggered during a test, the agent will:

1. Detect the download event
2. Wait for the download to complete
3. Verify the file was downloaded successfully
4. Show a success message with the file details

<img
  width="400px"
  src="/images/file-download-modal.png"
  alt="File Download Modal"
/>

To test file downloads just write the test like you normally would and the agent will handle the rest.
For example _Click the export button_ will automatically download the file and verify it was downloaded successfully.

### Download Limitations
