Revision history automatically tracks every change you make to your test cases. Each time you edit a test case, a new version is created, preserving a complete history of changes. You can view what changed between versions, see who made each change, and navigate to any previous version.

## Overview

Every edit to a test case creates a new revision, allowing you to track changes over time. Revision history helps you:

- See what changed between versions
- Understand when and who made changes
- Navigate to previous versions of your test case
- Compare revisions side-by-side

## Accessing Revision History

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Test Case Editor">
    Navigate to your test case and click to edit it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Version History">
    Click the "Version History" button or menu item in the test case editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Revisions">
    The Version History panel opens, showing all previous versions of the test
    case, ordered from newest to oldest
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Revisions

Each revision in the history shows:

- **Revision ID**: A shortened identifier for the version
- **Badges**:
  - **Current**: The active version of the test case (blue badge)
  - **Draft**: The latest version, if different from current (gray badge)
- **Date**: When the revision was created (relative time, e.g., "2 hours ago")
- **Creator**: The person who made the change (display name or email)
- **View Changes**: Button to compare this revision with the previous one

### What Gets Tracked

Revisions track changes to test case content:

| Tracked in Revisions | Not Tracked               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Steps                | Test case name            |
| Prompt examples      | Classification            |
| Prompt goal          | Status (enabled/disabled) |
| Required configs     | Labels                    |
| Start URL path       |                           |
| Agent selection      |                           |

Test case metadata (name, classification, status) is stored separately and not included in revision history.

## Working with Revisions

Click the "View Changes" button to compare revisions side-by-side, or click any revision ID to navigate to that version's edit view. When viewing an older version, banners indicate the revision state and provide quick navigation back to the current version.

## Limitations

- **Revisions cannot be deleted**: All revisions are preserved as historical records
- **No restore button**: To restore an old version, navigate to it and make edits from there
- **Diff shows JSON**: The change comparison displays JSON structure, not formatted test case steps
