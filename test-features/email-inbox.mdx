During test execution, the AI agent has access to an email inbox that can receive and process emails. This is useful for testing features like:

- Account verification
- Password reset flows
- Email notifications
- Newsletter subscriptions

The AI agent can:

- Open the email inbox
- Wait for new emails
- Read email content
- Extract One-Time Passwords (OTP)
- Click links in emails

The agent will poll for new emails for up to 3 minutes before timing out.

## Email Configs

QA.tech provides these system email configurations by default:

- **Single use Test Email Address** - New generated email for each test (can be re-used by having another test depend on the first)
- **Project e-mail address** - Static email always accessible for the project

**To use custom email addresses for testing:**

1. Navigate to Settings Â» Configs
2. Select "Email Inbox" type
3. Configure the email settings
4. Save the configuration
5. Add the config to your test case settings

## Using Email Inbox in Tests

1. Create or edit a test case
2. Under the Settings tab, select the email config to use
3. The test will now have access to the email inbox

## Manual Access

You can view test emails manually:

1. Go to Settings
2. Select Email Inbox
3. View all received test emails

## Important Considerations

- **Shared Inboxes**: If multiple tests use the same email inbox simultaneously (e.g., two password reset tests), emails may get mixed up. Use separate email configs for concurrent tests.

- **Email Inheritance**: Tests can access emails through:
  - Direct config assignment
  - Dependencies on other tests that use email configs
- **Timeout**: The agent will wait up to 3 minutes for expected emails before failing
- **Invitation Links** Since the browser state will be kept when opening the email you should log out after inviting a user to avoid that the invitation link redirects to the inviters account.
