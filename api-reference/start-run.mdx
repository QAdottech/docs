# Start Run API

The Start Run API allows you to programmatically trigger test runs for your projects. This endpoint is particularly useful for integrating QA.tech testing into your CI/CD pipelines and custom automation workflows.

The Start Run API provides a single endpoint to create new test runs:

- **Endpoint**: `POST /projects/{projectUuid}/runs`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (JWT) or Netlify webhook signature
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

## Authentication

The Start Run API supports two authentication methods:

### Bearer Token Authentication

Include your project's API token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

You can obtain your project's API token through the QA.tech dashboard in the project settings under "API & Integrations".

### Netlify Webhook Authentication

For Netlify webhook integrations, you can use webhook signature authentication instead of a Bearer token. Include the signed JWT token in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header:

```
X-Webhook-Signature: YOUR_SIGNED_JWT_TOKEN
```

The token is verified using your project's API token as the secret. Either authentication method is valid - use Bearer token for general API access or Netlify signature for webhook integrations.

## Finding Your Project UUID

Your project UUID is required in the URL path. Find it in your dashboard:

**Settings → Integrations → API** - Look at the code examples, your UUID is embedded in the URL between `/projects/` and `/runs` (36-character UUID format)

**Or** if using GitHub Actions: **Settings → Integrations → GitHub Actions** - Copy from the **QATECH_PROJECT_ID** field

For detailed instructions, see [Finding Your Project UUID](/api-reference/introduction#finding-your-project-uuid).

## Request Parameters

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `projectUuid` | string (UUID) | Yes | Your project's UUID (36-character format, NOT the short ID from URLs) |

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Description |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes | Media type of the request body |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN` | Yes* | Bearer token authentication (required if not using Netlify webhook signature) |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | `YOUR_SIGNED_JWT_TOKEN` | Yes* | Netlify webhook signature authentication (required if not using Bearer token) |

\* Either `Authorization` Bearer token OR `X-Webhook-Signature` header is required for authentication.

### Request Body

The request body is optional and can contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "integrationName": "CircleCI",
  "testPlanShortId": "abc123"
}
```

#### Optional Fields

- **`integrationName`** (string): Human-readable name of what triggered this test (defaults to "API")
- **`testPlanShortId`** (string): The **short ID** of the test plan to execute (this is the 6-character ID visible in test plan URLs)
- **`applications`** (object): Optional application environment overrides for testing specific environments. Each application can specify either a new environment (with `url` and `name`) or reference an existing environment (with `short_id`).

<Warning>
**Device Preset Limitation:** Environment overrides are supported via API, but device preset overrides are not. To test with different device configurations, create separate test plans with different device preset settings in the UI.
</Warning>

- **`notifications`** (array): Slack notification overrides for this run. Provide one or more channel objects to send run updates to specific channels instead of the project's default Slack channel. Details below.

### Slack Notification Overrides

Use the `notifications` array to send per-run Slack updates without changing your default integration settings. Each object must describe a Slack destination:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | Must be `slack` (currently the only supported notification type) |
| `channel` | string | Yes | Slack channel ID (e.g., `C0478ABCDEF`). The QA.tech bot must already have access to this channel. |
| `notifyOn` | string | No | Controls when notifications are sent for this channel. See options below. |

**`notifyOn` options:**

- **`always`** (default): Sends both a "run started" message when the run begins and the final result summary when it completes
- **`failure`**: Only sends the final summary when the run result is not `PASSED` (i.e., when result is `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, or `null`)

The run result values (`PASSED`, `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, or `null`) are determined when the run completes.

<Warning>
Slack notification overrides currently do not work for projects with SSH Tunnel Proxy enabled.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Slack to the project">
    Go to <strong>Project Settings → Integrations → Slack</strong>, connect your workspace, and invite the QA.tech bot to every channel you plan to target.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send per-run overrides">
    Include a <code>notifications</code> array in the Start Run API request body:
    ```json
    {
      "notifications": [
        { "type": "slack", "channel": "C0478ABCDEF", "notifyOn": "always" },
        { "type": "slack", "channel": "C0123FAIL42", "notifyOn": "failure" }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Behavior**

- **Start notifications**: When at least one override uses `notifyOn: "always"` (or omits `notifyOn`, which defaults to `always`), QA.tech emits the `slack/run-created` event and posts `Run #<shortId> started` to all channels in the override list as soon as the API call succeeds. If all channels have `notifyOn: "failure"`, no start notification event is triggered.
- **Finish notifications**: Each channel is evaluated independently based on its own `notifyOn` value:
  - Channels with `notifyOn: "always"` (or default) receive finish notifications regardless of run result.
  - Channels with `notifyOn: "failure"` only receive finish notifications when the run result is not `PASSED` (i.e., when result is `FAILED`, `SKIPPED`, or `null`).
- **Default channel override**: As soon as overrides are provided, QA.tech skips the default Slack channel configured in the integration and only uses the channels listed in the request.

**Validation & Errors**

- The `notifications` array must contain at least one object. Empty arrays are rejected with `400 Bad Request` and a schema validation error message.
- The API rejects overrides (`400 Bad Request`) if Slack is not connected for the project. Error message: `"Slack integration is not configured for this project. Configure Slack before overriding notification channels."`
- QA.tech fetches your accessible channel IDs and returns `400 Bad Request` when a requested channel is not found or the bot is not a member. The error message includes the specific inaccessible channel IDs: `"Slack channel override failed. Ensure the QA.tech bot has access to: C0478ABCDEF, C0123FAIL42"` (channel IDs are listed in the error).
- Schema validation errors include detailed Zod error messages when the request structure is invalid (e.g., missing required fields, invalid enum values).
