# Start Run API

The Start Run API allows you to programmatically trigger test runs for your projects. This endpoint is particularly useful for integrating QA.tech testing into your CI/CD pipelines and custom automation workflows.

The Start Run API provides a single endpoint to create new test runs:

- **Endpoint**: `POST /projects/{projectId}/runs`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (JWT)
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

## Authentication

The Start Run API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your project's API token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

You can obtain your project's API token through the QA.tech dashboard in the project settings under "API & Integrations".

## Request Parameters

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `projectId` | string | Yes | The unique identifier of your QA.tech project |

### Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Description |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes | Media type of the request body |

### Request Body

The request body is optional and can contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "integrationName": "CircleCI",
  "testPlanShortId": "abc123"
}
```

#### Optional Fields

- **`integrationName`** (string): Human-readable name of what triggered this test (defaults to "API")
- **`testPlanShortId`** (string): The short ID of the test plan to execute
- **`applications`** (object): Optional application environment overrides for testing specific environments. Each application can specify either a new environment (with `url` and `name`) or reference an existing environment (with `short_id`).

## Integration Examples

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: QA.tech Test Run

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger QA.tech Test
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/${{ secrets.QA_PROJECT_ID }}/runs \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.QA_API_TOKEN }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "integrationName": "GitHub Actions",
              "testPlanShortId": "${{ secrets.QA_TEST_PLAN_ID }}",
              "applications": {
                "frontend": {
                  "environment": {
