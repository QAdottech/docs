The QA.tech REST API allows you to programmatically control test runs, create test cases, check results, and integrate QA.tech into your CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows.

## What Can You Do?

- **Start test runs** programmatically from CI/CD pipelines or scripts
- **Create test cases** via API for importing tests or generating them dynamically
- **Check run status** and retrieve test results
- **Create environments** for preview deployments or dynamic test environments
- **View metrics** and test execution data

## Quick Start

Here's a complete example to start a test run:

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.qa.tech/api/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_UUID/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "integrationName": "API",
    "testPlanShortId": "abc123"
  }'
```

**What you need:**
1. **API Token** - Found in Settings → Integrations → API
2. **Project UUID** - Your project's 36-character UUID (see finding instructions below)
3. **Test Plan Short ID** - The 6-character ID from your test plan URL

## Authentication

All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

**Where to find your API token:**
1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → API** in your project dashboard
2. Your API token is displayed on the API integration page
3. Copy the token and use it in the `Authorization` header

<Note>
  Your API token is project-specific. Each project has its own token. Keep your token secure and never commit it to version control.
</Note>

## Finding Your Project UUID

Your project UUID is required for all API requests. It appears in code examples but is not shown as a separate labeled field in the API integration page.

### Option 1: From API Integration Page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Integrations** in your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select API Integration">
    Click on the **API** integration card
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find UUID in Code Examples">
    Look at the curl code examples on the page. Your project UUID is embedded in the URL path:
    
    `/api/projects/YOUR-PROJECT-UUID/runs`
    
    It's the long UUID string between `/projects/` and `/runs` (36 characters with dashes)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: From GitHub Actions Integration

If you're using GitHub Actions integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to GitHub Actions Integration">
    Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → GitHub Actions**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy QATECH_PROJECT_ID">
    You'll see a labeled field **QATECH_PROJECT_ID** with a copy button - this is your project UUID
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Different IDs

QA.tech uses five different types of identifiers. Make sure you use the correct one:

**Note:** All three "Short ID" types (Test Plan, Application, Environment) are 6-character alphanumeric strings, but they identify different resources and are used in different parts of the API request.

| ID Type | Format | Where You See It | Use In API | Example |
|---------|--------|------------------|------------|---------|
| **Project UUID** | 36-character UUID | Code examples, GitHub Actions settings | Path parameter: `/api/projects/{projectUuid}/runs` | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` |
| **Test Plan Short ID** | 6-character alphanumeric | Browser URLs, test result pages | Request body: `"testPlanShortId": "abc123"` | `abc123` |
| **Application Short ID** | 6-character alphanumeric | Settings -> Applications (Short ID column) | Key in `applications` object | `gXeBl2` |
| **Environment Short ID** | 6-character alphanumeric | Settings -> Applications -> [App] -> Environments | `environment.short_id` field | `aB3xY9` |
| **API Token** | UUID string | API settings page | Header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}` | `32fc11c3-9be4-4bb9-a220-7a4ca4427335` |

### Finding Application Short IDs

The Application Short ID is the key you use in the `applications` object when overriding environments via API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Applications">
    Navigate to **Settings -> Applications** in your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Short ID Column">
    The Short ID appears in its own column in the applications table
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Short ID">
    Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to any application and select **Copy Short ID**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Finding Environment Short IDs

The Environment Short ID references an existing environment in API requests (using `environment.short_id`).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Application Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings -> Applications -> [Select Application]**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Environment Short ID">
    In the **Environments** section, the Short ID appears above each environment name in monospace font
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Short ID">
    Hover to reveal the copy icon, or click the three-dot menu (⋮) and select **Copy Short ID**
  </Step>
</Steps>
