## What is BankID

BankID is a digital identification system widely used in countries like Sweden, Norway, and Finland. It allows individuals to securely prove their identity online and authorize electronic transactions.

## How to test BankID

You need to stub or circumvent BankID in your testing environment to use QA.tech.

From BankID's official documentation:

> **How do I test my BankID implementation? How about automation?**
>
> Testing can't be automated. Passwords/Security codes have to be manually entered in the BankID clients. We recommend building a so-called test stub that simulates the BankID service web service. It can also be used to perform load tests on your services.

## What is stubbing?

Stubbing is the process of replacing a component (like BankID integration) with a placeholder used within a testing environment. This has to be done by your development team.

In the case of BankID it can be that you ask the user to provide a specific personal identity number, like 199001011234, and always grant that user access. Note that this should only be permitted in a _testing_ environment, never in production.

On the client:

```
if (environment === 'testing') {
  // Show stub UI for BankID
} else {
  // Show real BankID
}
```

and on the server:

```
if (environment === 'testing') {
  if (personalNumber === '199001011234') // Send a auth success response
  else // send a auth failed response
} else {
  // Auth using real BankID
}
```
