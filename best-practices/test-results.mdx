## How to review test results

We recommend the following process:

1. Assign someone on your team to manage the results. This can be the **QA team** or the **developer** responsible for the PR/release that triggered the test run.
2. If a test fails, triage it by:
   - Navigating to the failing test.
   - Reviewing the playback to see what went wrong.
3. If the issue is related to your product:
   - Handle it as you typically would for regressions in your product.
4. If the failure is due to a bad test:
   - Modify the failed step to better guide the agent for future runs. For example, you might choose to make the step more or less deterministic, depending on your needs.

## Notifications

The best way to get notified of a failing test is to set up [Notifications](/core-concepts/notifications)

## Export the Issues

When we find an Issue it's tracked and saved - and you can always export them to your own project management tool - we have multiple integrations. See the Integrations section in the bottom left.
