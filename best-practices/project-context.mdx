## What should i add to the project context?

The project context should be information that the AI agent should be aware of when executing tests. It can, for example be information about your service that helps the agent understand the website better.

## Examples:

These are some examples of things that could be added to the project context:

- The service is a route planning service for American railways.
- When creating users, always use Swedish names.
- Always fail tests when obvious typos are found.
- If a button is red, it should never be clicked.
