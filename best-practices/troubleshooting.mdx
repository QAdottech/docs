## The agent doesn't understand what to click

We use a combination of the DOM and visual models to decide what to click or interact with. To make it easier for our agent to understand your site, we suggest taking the following measures.

1. Make your site more accessible
   Ensure all your elements are tagged with the correct `aria`-labels, as well as `title` and `alt` attributes.

2. Use semantic HTML tags
   For example, utilize `<a>` or `<button>` element for clickable elements (as opposed to `div`s).
