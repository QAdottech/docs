# Authentication Support for QA.tech

QA.tech supports most common authentication setups. If your preferred authentication method isn't listed below, let us know, and we'll consider adding it to our roadmap.

<Warning>
  **Security Notice: Use Test Credentials Only**
  
  Authentication credentials stored in [Configs](/core-concepts/configs) are **not encrypted** and are passed to AI language models during test execution. Always use dedicated test accounts—never real user credentials or production passwords.
</Warning>

## What We Support

| Authentication Method | Description | Setup Required |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Username + Password | Standard form-based login with username/email and password | Basic Config |
| Email + Password | Login using email address and password | Basic Config |
| OTP via Email | One-time passwords sent to email addresses | Email Config + Inbox |
| Magic Link Login | Passwordless login via email links | Email Config + Inbox (auto-generated) |
| Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) | Time-based codes from authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) | Advanced Config (see below) |

## What We Don't Support

- **BankID** - Requires custom workarounds in your testing environment ([see guide](/applications/se-bank-id))
- **CAPTCHA challenges** - Most CAPTCHA types (reCAPTCHA, hCAPTCHA, etc.) are not supported.

<Tip>
**Avoid CAPTCHA on staging/dev:** Whitelist QA.tech's IP addresses to prevent CAPTCHA challenges during test execution. This allows our AI agents to run tests without interruption. Find your IP addresses in [**Settings → Network**](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/settings/network) and see the [IP Access Control guide](/configuration/ip-access-control) for setup instructions.

## Setting Up Authentication

### Basic Credentials (Username/Password or Email/Password)

For standard login forms, create a config in your project settings:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Configs**
2. Click **Add Config**
3. Select **Username + Password Credentials** or **Email + Password Credentials**
4. Fill in your test account credentials
5. Click **Save**

The AI will automatically use these credentials when it encounters a login form during test execution.

<Tip>
**Build a comprehensive knowledge graph:** If your application has different user types (admin, regular user, premium user, etc.), create separate authentication configs for each. Login tests can automatically trigger [crawling sessions](/core-concepts/crawling) after completion, allowing QA.tech to map out what each user type can access. This helps the AI generate more accurate tests tailored to different user permissions.
</Tip>

### Email-Based OTP

For authentication flows that send one-time passwords to email:

1. QA.tech provides dedicated email inboxes for each project
2. The AI can automatically read OTP codes from emails sent to these addresses
3. Configure email settings in **Project Settings** → **Configs**
4. When writing tests, the AI will wait for and extract OTP codes automatically

QA.tech's built-in email inbox system allows the AI to receive and process emails during test execution - no need to set up external email services or worry about email delivery. The AI can wait for emails (up to 3 minutes), extract verification codes, and click links automatically. Learn more about [Email Inbox](/test-features/email-inbox).

### Magic Link Login

For passwordless authentication via email links:

1. QA.tech automatically provides a magic link email address for each project (no setup required)
2. Enter this email address in your application's login form
3. The AI automatically waits for the email, extracts the login link, and navigates to it

<Tip>
Create a test user account in your application using the magic link email address shown in your project's [**Magic Link Login** config](/core-concepts/configs) before running tests.
</Tip>

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

QA.tech allows testing login flows that are protected by Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). 
#### How 2FA Testing Works

Most modern 2FA systems use **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**. This is the constantly changing, 6-digit code you see in apps like **Google Authenticator**, **Authy**, or **Microsoft Authenticator**.

To test this, our AI needs the secret key that your application uses to generate these codes. You provide this secret key to us once, and our AI handles the rest.

- **Your Role (One-Time Setup):** You will create a special `Config` in your QA.tech project settings. Instead of giving us a static 6-digit code, you will provide a special secret key in a format called a **URI**.
- **Our AI's Role (During Every Test):** When the AI agent encounters a 2FA screen during a test, it will use the secret URI you provided to generate a **fresh, valid 6-digit code** at that exact moment. It then automatically enters the code to complete the login.

This way, you never have to worry about codes expiring or manually entering them during a test run.

#### Setting Up a 2FA Config

Follow these steps to create a config for a test user account that has 2FA enabled.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your 2FA QR Code">
    Log in to the application you want to test and go to the security settings for your test user. Find the option to enable Two-Factor Authentication and proceed until the application shows you a **QR code**.
    
    Stop here. Do not scan it with your phone. We need to extract the secret key from this image.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decode the QR Code to Get the URI">
    The QR code contains a secret key that our AI needs. You can use a free online tool to extract this key.

1. Take a screenshot of the QR code.
2. Go to a site like [**scanqr.org**](https://scanqr.org/) in your browser.
3. Upload the screenshot of the QR code.
4. The tool will decode it and reveal a string of text called a URI. Copy this entire string. It will look something like this:

```text
otpauth://totp/YourApp:test.user@example.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=YourApp
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Config in QA.tech">
    Now, let's add the credentials and the secret URI to QA.tech.

1. Navigate to your QA.tech project, go to **Settings**, and click on the **Configs** tab.
2. Click the **Add Config** button.
3. From the list of types, select **Username + Password Credentials - with Two-Factor Authentication**.
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Config Name:** Give it a memorable name (e.g., "Admin User with 2FA").
   - **Username:** The username for your test account.
   - **Password:** The password for your test account.
   - **One-Time Password URI:** Paste the full `otpauth://` URI you copied from the QR code scanner.
5. Click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Running Tests with 2FA Enabled

You're all set! You do not need to add any special instructions to your tests like "enter the 2FA code."

When you ask the AI to perform a test that involves logging in (e.g., "Log in and check the user dashboard"), the agent will automatically:
1. Use the username and password from your new config.
2. When it sees the 2FA input screen, it will automatically generate a valid code using the URI you provided.
3. It will enter the code and complete the login before proceeding with the rest of your test instructions.
