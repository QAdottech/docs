# Authentication Support for QA.tech

QA.tech supports most common authentication setups. If your preferred authentication method isn’t listed below, let us know, and we’ll consider adding it to our roadmap.

## Supported Authentication Methods

- Username and password
- Email and password
- OTP (One-Time Password) via email
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with authenticator codes

## Unsupported Authentication Methods

### BankID

Unfortunately, BankID does not offer straightforward methods for testing authentication logic in a controlled environment. This limitation often requires implementing custom exceptions or workarounds to enable effective testing.

One approach is to adjust the BankID sign-in flow in your testing environment. For example:

```
// When displaying the BankID sign-in form
if (process.env.IS_TESTING === '1') {
  // Show a form where the user can manually enter their personal number
  renderTestSignInForm();
}
```

```
// When handling the form submission
if (process.env.IS_TESTING === '1') {
  // Do not send the request to BankID
  // Instead, return a mocked successful response
  return { status: 'success', userId: 'mock-user-id' };
}
```

This setup allows you to simulate the BankID login process during tests by bypassing the actual authentication request while maintaining realistic interaction with the UI.
