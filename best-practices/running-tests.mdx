Tests in QA.tech can be run in several ways.

## Trigger a Run from the UI

The simplest way to get started is to use the "Run Tests" button found on the [Dashboard](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project) or the [Test Cases](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/scenarios) page.

You can also run individual tests by navigating to the test and clicking **Run Test**.

<Note>
  When running multiple tests via a **Test Plan**, QA.tech automatically
  executes them in parallel where the dependency graph allows, with auto-scaling
  up to approximately 100 concurrent agents. This significantly reduces total
  execution time compared to running tests individually. Learn more in [Test
  Plans](/core-concepts/test-plans#performance--parallel-execution).
</Note>

## Trigger a Run as Part of a Pipeline

You can also integrate test runs as part of your **CI pipeline**.

You can use any system that supports sending an HTTPS POST request when you want to trigger the tests.

For a great example, check out our [GitHub Actions documentation](/configuration/github).

## Trigger a Run on a Schedule

If you want your tests to run at a specific time, such as on a recurring weekly schedule (cron-style), we offer that functionality as well.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Test Plans">
    Go to [Test Plans](https://app.qa.tech/dashboard/current-project/test-plans)
    in your project dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or Create a Test Plan">
    Click on an existing test plan that you want to schedule, or create a new
    one if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Schedules">
    Click on **Manage Schedules** within the test plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Schedule">
    Add your cron schedule expression and a description, then click **Add
    Schedule**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you're unsure how to write the cron format, you can use a tool like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) or reach out to us, and we'll be happy to help you get set up.
